# 1. Objectives and Pathways to Impact Statement a) Project Objectives (max. 800 words)

Urbanization has significantly improved transport infrastructure and mobility in cities worldwide, with an increasing number of cities operating or planning metro systems. However, advanced public transport systems like metros do not serve all population groups equally. The transport equity literature has shown that different social strata benefit unevenly from transit services. Women, in particular, often face distinct mobility challenges compared with men. Many of these challenges—such as voyeurism, sexual harassment, and the disrespect of breastfeeding—are underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma. As a result, they remain largely invisible to passengers, operators, and policymakers, and receive limited coverage in mainstream media. This issue is particularly acute in developing countries, where limited surveillance and policing exacerbate the problem. To address this gap, the proposed research will use a social media analytics approach to capture and analyse unspoken, real-world experiences of women in metro systems globally. Theoretically, it contributes to the transport equity discourse by foregrounding gendered mobility barriers. Methodologically, it introduces a novel application of social media analytics in transport research. Empirically, it will build a unique dataset of gendered metro experiences across diverse contexts. Practically, the study will provide actionable insights for policymakers and transit operators to improve safety, inclusivity, and equity in metro systems.

Achieving transport equity requires addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged groups, including women. A safer and more inclusive travel experience can increase women’s mobility, empowering them to access employment, education, and social opportunities across the city and beyond. From a societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit not only enhances their well-being but also supports broader goals of social inclusion and gender equality. In advanced economies such as Japan and Hong Kong, urban metros are the backbone of the transport network, carrying the majority of daily trips. Yet even in these systems, women often feel unsafe, particularly at night or in sparsely populated areas and lines. In contrast, in cities where metros are less dominant and public transport use is lower, reduced crowds do not necessarily translate into safety. Limited public surveillance can increase women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts. By systematically addressing these challenges, this research will advance knowledge on gender and mobility, inform evidencebased interventions, and ultimately contribute to creating safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole.

We propose a novel approach that leverages social media data to uncover gendered experiences in metro systems across a range of global cities. Using keywords such as “metro” and related terms in multiple languages, we will retrieve and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. Guided by a set of predefined service quality dimensions—particularly focusing on safety—we will apply sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to examine and compare the experiences of women and men. To gain deeper insights, we will conduct case studies in three Asian cities—tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Doha. In these cities, we will investigate how women’s perceptions of safety are expressed, interpreted, and linked to their actual travel behavior. By mapping these concerns onto women's activity spaces, we aim to reveal how perceived or experienced barriers constrain their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities. This mixed-method approach integrates large-scale digital data with urban transport research to generate actionable knowledge on gendered mobility barriers.

Our solution improves upon existing approaches to transport equity in three key ways: 1. Leveraging social media analytics: By mining and analyzing large-scale social media data, we can uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit— particularly in developing countries where official reporting is limited. By employing a multidimensional selection framework that encompasses economic development (GDP per capita), gender equality (Gender Inequality Index), digital infrastructure (internet penetration rates), urban characteristics, and transport-specific metrics, we will generate a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers across diverse socioeconomic contexts. 2. Developing customized language models: We will build our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. 3. Integrating digital analytics with case studies: Through in-depth case studies in three Asian cities, we will complement our large-scale data analysis with focus group studies. This mixed-method approach will allow us to directly link women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. Together, these innovations will generate richer, more actionable insights than traditional surveys or qualitative studies alone, advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

## Objective 1: To select a list of representative countries and to collect data on passengers' perception of metro systems

For country selection, we will employ a comprehensive set of indicators that capture economic development, gender equality, urban characteristics, and digital infrastructure. Beyond GDP per capita and the Gender Inequality Index (GII), our selection framework includes: (1) internet penetration rates to evaluate digital accessibility; (2) urban development indicators including population density and service sector employment; (3) transport-specific metrics such as metro usage patterns; and (5) additional gender-specific indicators including educational attainment gaps and labor force participation differentials.

The rationale for this multidimensional approach is threefold. First, it ensures representation across diverse economic and social contexts. Second, the inclusion of digital infrastructure indicators is crucial for our social media analytics methodology, as countries with higher internet penetration are more likely to generate substantial social media content relevant to metro experiences. Third, by incorporating urban and transport-specific metrics, we capture contextual factors that influence metro system operations and passenger experiences. Preliminary analysis (see Appendix) demonstrates the distribution of countries with metro systems across GDP and GII quadrants, revealing opportunities for comparative analysis across different development levels and gender equality contexts.

## Objective 2: To develop a large language model for sentiment analysis of gendered experiences on the metro systems

The second objective focuses on developing a customized large language model (LLM) specifically designed for sentiment analysis of gendered experiences in metro systems. We will create a specialized LLM architecture that integrates multilingual processing capabilities with domain-specific knowledge about transit operations and gendered mobility patterns. This model will be trained on carefully curated social media data from the selected cities, incorporating both textual content and associated spatio-temporal metadata to enable context-aware sentiment classification.

Our approach will leverage state-of-the-art sentiment models (such as RoBERTa) fine-tuned with transit-specific vocabulary and gendered experience indicators. The model will be designed to recognize expressions of safety concerns, sexual harassment experiences, comfort levels, and service quality perceptions that are often expressed indirectly or through culturally specific linguistic patterns. By incorporating spatio-temporal encoders, the model will learn to associate sentiments with specific operational contexts (e.g., peak hours, particular stations or lines), enabling more accurate interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts. This customized LLM will overcome the limitations of generic sentiment analysis tools by providing domain-adapted, culturally sensitive, and contextually aware analysis of women's metro experiences globally.

## Objective 3: To develop a dashboard to visualize spatial-temporal gendered perspective of metro service quality

The third objective focuses on developing an interactive dashboard that visualizes the spatio-temporal patterns of gendered metro service quality perceptions derived from social media analytics. Building upon the sentiment analysis outputs from Objective 2, this dashboard will integrate multiple data layers including sentiment scores, geographic locations of metro stations and lines, temporal patterns (hourly, daily, seasonal variations), and gender-specific sentiment distributions. The visualization platform will employ heatmaps to display spatial concentrations of gendered safety concerns, time-series charts to reveal temporal patterns of service quality perceptions, and comparative visualizations to highlight gender disparities across different operational contexts.

The dashboard will feature interactive capabilities allowing policymakers and transit operators to filter data by specific time periods, metro lines, stations, and service quality dimensions (particularly safety). This will enable the identification of spatial hotspots and temporal patterns of gendered mobility barriers, facilitating targeted interventions. 

Note: We can use the case of Hong Kong to demonstrate the dashboard. We can include the basic version in the appendix (not in the main text)

## Objective 4: To triangulate the big data findings through focus group studies in three cities

We will also employ a mixed-methods approach to validate and contextualize the insights derived from large-scale social media analytics. Through structured focus group discussions in three selected Asian cities, this research will triangulate quantitative findings with rich qualitative data. These discussions will explore how women articulate their perceptions of traveling experiences using the metro, how these perceptions are interpreted in specific cultural and urban contexts, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors and mobility patterns. This triangulation ensures that digital insights from social media analytics  accurately reflect lived experiences rather than remaining as statistical figures, while also revealing the consequences of perceived or experienced barriers on women's access to urban public transport.

The focus group studies will serve multiple critical functions: validating sentiment analysis outputs from the customized LLM, identifying culturally specific manifestations of gendered mobility barriers, and uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving observed patterns in social media data. By mapping traveling concerns onto women's activity spaces, this objective will demonstrate how fear or harassment constrains access to employment, education, and social engagement. The qualitative insights will inform the development of targeted, contextually appropriate interventions and provide policymakers with actionable recommendations for creating safer, more inclusive metro systems that address the specific needs identified through both digital and direct engagement methodologies.

Note: The research collaborators will help conduct focus group studies in the selected cities.

We will develop a dashboard architecture that integrates multiple visualization components to display gendered metro service quality perceptions derived from social media analytics. The dashboard will feature a modular design with separate panels for spatial analysis, temporal patterns, service quality dimensions, and gender-specific sentiment distributions. The architecture will employ a responsive web framework for interactive visualizations and spatio-temporal mapping. The design will prioritize user-friendly interfaces for policymakers and transit operators, enabling intuitive navigation and data exploration across different analytical dimensions.

Task 3.2: Spatio-Temporal Visualization Components
The dashboard will incorporate advanced visualization techniques to represent complex spatio-temporal patterns. Heatmaps will display spatial concentrations of gendered traveling concerns across metro networks, with color gradients indicating sentiment intensity. Time-series charts will reveal hourly, daily, and seasonal variations in service quality perceptions. Comparative visualizations will highlight gender disparities across different operational contexts, including peak/off-peak hours and specific metro lines. GIS integration will enable precise mapping of sentiment hotspots to physical metro infrastructure, providing contextual understanding of spatial patterns.

Task 3.3: Interactive Filtering and Analytical Features
Interactive capabilities will allow users to filter data by specific time periods, metro lines, stations, and service dimensions. Dynamic filtering controls will enable real-time exploration of gendered mobility barriers across different operational scenarios.

We will implement a robust data processing pipeline that continuously integrates sentiment analysis outputs from the customized LLM with real-time operational data. The pipeline will handle large-scale social media data streams, perform spatial-temporal aggregation, and update visualization components in near real-time. Automated data quality checks and validation procedures will ensure the reliability of dashboard metrics. The system will support both historical trend analysis and current operational monitoring, providing comprehensive insights into evolving gendered mobility patterns.

Task 3.5: Multi-city Comparative Framework and Deployment
The dashboard will incorporate a comparative framework enabling side-by-side analysis of gendered metro experiences across different cities. This will facilitate cross-cultural comparisons and identification of universal versus context-specific mobility barriers. The deployment strategy will include cloud-based hosting for scalability, secure access controls for different user roles (policymakers, researchers, transit operators), and comprehensive documentation for sustainable maintenance. 

## Task 4: Focus Group Studies for Methodological Triangulation

Task 4.1: Focus Group Protocol Development and Cultural Adaptation
We will develop a focus group protocol specifically designed to triangulate findings from social media analytics. The protocol will include semi-structured discussion guides that explore women's lived experiences, safety perceptions, and mobility constraints in metro systems. Cultural adaptation will be a critical component, with protocols tailored to local contexts in each of the selected cities. 

Task 4.2: Participant Recruitment and Stratified Sampling Strategy
A stratified sampling approach will be employed to recruit diverse participants representing different demographic profiles, travel patterns, and metro usage frequencies. Recruitment will target regular female metro users across various age groups, socioeconomic backgrounds, and occupational categories. Special attention will be given to including vulnerable groups who may face mobility barriers. Local research collaborators will facilitate culturally appropriate recruitment strategies and ensure informed consent procedures adhere to ethical standards for qualitative research involving sensitive topics.

Task 4.3: Multi-city Focus Group Implementation and Data Collection
Structured focus group discussions will be conducted in each of the three selected cities, with 50-100 participants per group and multiple sessions to ensure data saturation. Sessions will be facilitated by trained moderators with expertise in gender and transportation research, assisted by local collaborators for cultural and linguistic mediation. Discussions will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, with simultaneous translation for multilingual contexts. Observational notes and non-verbal cues will be documented to capture nuanced expressions of gendered mobility experiences.

Task 4.4: Qualitative Data Analysis and Thematic Coding
A qualitative analysis framework will be implemented for thematic coding and pattern identification. The analysis will employ a combination of deductive coding based on predefined service quality dimensions and inductive coding to emerge new themes from participant narratives. Intercoder reliability procedures will ensure analytical consistency across research teams. The analysis will specifically focus on validating sentiment analysis outputs, identifying culturally specific manifestations of mobility barriers, and uncovering underlying mechanisms driving observed digital patterns.

Task 4.5: Methodological Triangulation and Validation Framework
A systematic triangulation framework will be developed to integrate quantitative findings from social media analytics with qualitative insights from focus groups. This will involve mapping digital sentiment patterns onto qualitative narratives, comparing spatial-temporal hotspots with lived experience accounts, and validating the customized LLM's performance in capturing authentic gendered experiences. Discrepancies between digital and qualitative findings will be critically examined to identify limitations of each methodology and develop more robust mixed-methods approaches.

Task 4.6: Policy Recommendation Development and Knowledge Translation
The integrated findings will inform the development of contextually appropriate policy recommendations and intervention strategies. Focus group insights will provide granular understanding of how perceived and experienced barriers translate into concrete mobility constraints, enabling targeted recommendations for metro system improvements. Knowledge translation activities will include co-design workshops with policymakers and transit operators to ensure research findings are translated into actionable interventions that address the specific needs identified through both digital and qualitative methodologies.
