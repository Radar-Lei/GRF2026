Urbanization has significantly improved transport infrastructure and mobility in cities worldwide, with an increasing number of cities operating or planning metro systems. However, advanced public transport systems like metros do not serve all population groups equally. The transport equity literature has shown that different social strata benefit unevenly from transit services. Women, in particular, often face distinct mobility challenges compared with men. Many of these challenges—such as voyeurism, sexual harassment, and the disrespect of breastfeeding—are underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma. As a result, they remain largely invisible to passengers, operators, and policymakers, and receive limited coverage in mainstream media. This issue is particularly acute in developing countries, where limited surveillance and policing exacerbate the problem. To address this gap, the proposed research will use a social media analytics approach to capture and analyse unspoken, real-world experiences of women in metro systems globally. Theoretically, it contributes to the transport equity discourse by foregrounding gendered mobility barriers. Methodologically, it introduces a novel application of social media analytics in transport research. Empirically, it will build a unique dataset of gendered metro experiences across diverse contexts. Practically, the study will provide actionable insights for policymakers and transit operators to improve safety, inclusivity, and equity in metro systems.

Achieving transport equity requires addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged groups, including women. A safer and more inclusive travel experience can increase women’s mobility, empowering them to access employment, education, and social opportunities across the city and beyond. From a societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit not only enhances their well-being but also supports broader goals of social inclusion and gender equality. In advanced economies such as Japan and Hong Kong, urban metros are the backbone of the transport network, carrying the majority of daily trips. Yet even in these systems, women often feel unsafe, particularly at night or in sparsely populated areas and lines. In contrast, in cities where metros are less dominant and public transport use is lower, reduced crowds do not necessarily translate into safety. Limited public surveillance can increase women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts. By systematically addressing these challenges, this research will advance knowledge on gender and mobility, inform evidencebased interventions, and ultimately contribute to creating safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole.

We propose a novel approach that leverages social media data to uncover gendered experiences in metro systems across a range of global cities. Using keywords such as “metro” and related terms in multiple languages, we will retrieve and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. Guided by a set of predefined service quality dimensions—particularly focusing on safety—we will apply sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to examine and compare the experiences of women and men. To gain deeper insights, we will conduct case studies in three Asian cities—tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Riyadh. In these cities, we will investigate how women’s perceptions of safety are expressed, interpreted, and linked to their actual travel behavior. By mapping these concerns onto women's activity spaces, we aim to reveal how perceived or experienced barriers constrain their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities. This mixed-method approach integrates large-scale digital data with urban transport research to generate actionable knowledge on gendered mobility barriers.

Our solution improves upon existing approaches to transport equity in three key ways: 1. Leveraging social media analytics: By mining and analyzing large-scale social media data, we can uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit— particularly in developing countries where official reporting is limited. By employing a multidimensional selection framework that encompasses economic development (GDP per capita), gender equality (Gender Inequality Index), digital infrastructure (internet penetration rates), urban characteristics, and transport-specific metrics, we will generate a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers across diverse socioeconomic contexts. 2. Developing customized language models: We will build our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. 3. Integrating digital analytics with case studies: Through in-depth case studies in three Asian cities, we will complement our large-scale data analysis with focus group studies. This mixed-method approach will allow us to directly link women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. Together, these innovations will generate richer, more actionable insights than traditional surveys or qualitative studies alone, advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

## Objective 1: To select a list of representative countries and to collect data on passengers' perception of metro systems

For country selection, we will employ a comprehensive set of indicators that capture economic development, gender equality, urban characteristics, and digital infrastructure. Beyond GDP per capita and the Gender Inequality Index (GII), our selection framework includes: (1) internet penetration rates to evaluate digital accessibility; (2) urban development indicators including population density and service sector employment; (3) transport-specific metrics such as metro usage patterns; and (5) additional gender-specific indicators including educational attainment gaps and labor force participation differentials.

The rationale for this multidimensional approach is threefold. First, it ensures representation across diverse economic and social contexts. Second, the inclusion of digital infrastructure indicators is crucial for our social media analytics methodology, as countries with higher internet penetration are more likely to generate substantial social media content relevant to metro experiences. Third, by incorporating urban and transport-specific metrics, we capture contextual factors that influence metro system operations and passenger experiences. Preliminary analysis (see Appendix) demonstrates the distribution of countries with metro systems across GDP and GII quadrants, revealing opportunities for comparative analysis across different development levels and gender equality contexts.
