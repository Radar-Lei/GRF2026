## 1. Travel Satisfaction Analysis Using Questionnaires or Survey Data

The traditional approach to assessing travel satisfaction, particularly within the realm of public transportation, has long been dominated by the deployment of questionnaires and structured surveys. This methodology involves directly soliciting feedback from passengers through a series of predefined questions, often administered in-person, via mail, or online. The primary objective is to quantify passenger perceptions across various service attributes, thereby providing transit agencies with actionable data for service improvement and strategic planning. Numerous studies have successfully employed this method to dissect the multifaceted nature of transit satisfaction, identifying key determinants and areas for intervention.

Early research, such as that by Iseki & Taylor (2010), delved into user perceptions of transit stops and stations, highlighting the often-overlooked out-of-vehicle segments of transit travel. Their survey of 749 transit users in Los Angeles revealed that while physical characteristics of facilities contribute to satisfaction, the most critical determinants were frequent, reliable service and personal safety. This finding underscores that operational aspects often outweigh aesthetic considerations in passenger satisfaction. Similarly, Ismail et al. (2013) conducted a comparative analysis of passenger preference and satisfaction for different public transportation modes in Malaysia, specifically train commuter (KTM) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) networks. Their survey of 312 respondents identified facilities, comfort, and quality of services as key parameters, concluding that LRT services generally garnered higher satisfaction than Komuter, suggesting areas for improvement in the latter.

Further refining the understanding of satisfaction drivers, Cao & Cao (2017) compared Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) and three-factor theory to assess rider satisfaction with transit services in Guangzhou, China. Using 2013 survey data from bus, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), and metro riders, they found divergent improvement priorities across different services, such as comfort while waiting and service reliability for buses, and spatial coverage for metro transit. This study highlighted the importance of tailoring improvement strategies to specific transit modes and their unique user experiences. The complexity of factors influencing satisfaction was also explored by Cheng et al. (2018), who modeled the satisfaction of bus traffic transfer service quality at a high-speed railway station. Their structural equation model (SEM), calibrated with a questionnaire survey at Xi'anbei Railway Station, identified economy and convenience as critical influential indicators, with bus fare preferential policy and transfer distance being particularly significant. This detailed breakdown of factors provides granular insights for planners.

The scope of survey-based analysis extends to specific demographic groups and service contexts. For instance, Yuan et al. (2019) focused on assessing bus transit service from the perspective of elderly passengers in Harbin, China. Their study, using a customer satisfaction index (CSI) and SEM, revealed that while time schedule and reliability were less critical for the elderly, convenience, safety, security, and driver service were highly important and in need of improvement. This highlights the necessity of segmenting passenger populations to address diverse needs. Similarly, Pan et al. (2024) investigated the influence of passenger gender, age, and educational background on satisfaction with urban rail transit in Qingdao, China, using 6340 valid questionnaires. Their findings indicated that women prioritize caring aspects more than men, older passengers report higher satisfaction than younger ones, and highly educated or high-income passengers show lower satisfaction in terms of safety, convenience, and comfort. Such demographic-specific insights are crucial for targeted service enhancements.


Beyond general satisfaction, surveys have been instrumental in understanding specific aspects of service quality. Wu et al. (2016) applied Bayesian networks to quantify the influence of various service attributes on passenger overall satisfaction with regular bus service in Nanjing, China. Their analysis of 609 passengers identified running on schedule, acceptable waiting time, available seats, clean onboard environment, pleasant environment at stations, convenient design for transfers, and air-conditioning as key determinants. This detailed understanding of interrelationships among attributes helps prioritize improvements. Ibrahim et al. (2022) and Ibrahim et al. (2021) further explored the influence of service quality on user satisfaction with Light Rail Transit (LRT) in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Through in-person questionnaires, they identified factors like information signs, amenities, safety, and employee performance as crucial. Notably, Ibrahim et al. (2021) specifically highlighted that gender and age significantly affect perceptions of LRT service quality, with factors like provision of information, comfort, and staff service being critical determinants across most segments.

The utility of surveys also extends to evaluating the impact of specific interventions or changes. Zhang et al. (2021), for example, studied the behavioral intentions of urban rail transit passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Tianjin, China, integrating the theory of planned behavior and customer satisfaction theory. Their survey of 983 residents revealed how transport management policies under COVID-19 influenced commuters’ intentions primarily via subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, perceived service quality, and customer satisfaction. This demonstrates the capacity of surveys to capture responses to dynamic external factors. He et al. (2023) similarly examined the impact of COVID-19 and social distancing on transport mode usage and travel satisfaction in Hong Kong, finding that an efficient public transport system improved passenger satisfaction, with reduced crowdedness enhancing this effect.

Furthermore, surveys have been used to explore the nuances of travel experience beyond single modes. Abenoza et al. (2018) analyzed how satisfaction with individual trip legs aggregates to overall travel experience for multimodal trips, finding that weighting satisfaction with individual trip legs by perceived duration yielded the best predictor of overall travel satisfaction. This highlights the importance of considering the entire door-to-door journey. Wang & Loo (2018) investigated the influence of in-vehicle e-activities on high-speed railway passengers' travel satisfaction, finding that higher use of ICT devices and engagement in e-activities (work-related for business trips, entertainment for leisure trips) positively affected satisfaction. This points to evolving passenger needs in the digital age. Susilo & Cats (2014), using a dataset from an experimental survey in eight European cities, identified key determinants of travel satisfaction for multi-modal trips by different traveler groups, emphasizing the role of past experience, traveler expectations, attitudes, and emotional state.

Despite their widespread use and the valuable insights they have provided, manual surveys and questionnaires suffer from several inherent drawbacks and limitations. Firstly, cost and time intensiveness are significant barriers. Designing, distributing, collecting, and analyzing large-scale surveys require substantial financial resources and human effort (Liu et al., 2019). This often limits the frequency and scope of surveys, meaning that transit agencies might only conduct them annually or biannually, providing a static snapshot of satisfaction that quickly becomes outdated in a dynamic operational environment. The time lag between data collection and actionable insights can hinder timely responses to emerging issues or service changes.


Secondly, limited sample size and representativeness are common issues. While some studies, like Pan et al. (2024), managed to collect a large number of responses (6340), achieving truly representative samples across diverse demographics, travel patterns, and geographic areas is challenging. Self-selection bias is prevalent, as only those willing to participate will respond, potentially skewing results towards highly satisfied or highly dissatisfied individuals, or those with specific motivations. This can lead to an incomplete or distorted understanding of overall passenger sentiment. Rodriguez-Valencia et al. (2019) highlighted challenges in measuring "importance" in IPA, noting that choosing a specific method has diverse implications and can introduce biases.

Thirdly, surveys are prone to self-report bias and social desirability bias. Respondents may provide answers they believe are socially acceptable or what the survey designers expect, rather than their true feelings. Memory recall bias is also a factor, as passengers are asked to reflect on past experiences, which may not be accurately remembered or may be influenced by their current mood or recent events. This can lead to inaccuracies in the reported satisfaction levels.

Fourthly, the snapshot nature of survey data means it captures sentiment at a specific point in time, failing to reflect the real-time fluctuations in satisfaction that occur due to daily operational disruptions, weather conditions, or special events. This lack of temporal granularity makes it difficult for transit agencies to respond dynamically to immediate issues or to understand the short-term impacts of service changes.

Fifthly, surveys often lack the spontaneity and richness of unsolicited feedback. The structured format of questionnaires limits respondents to predefined options, potentially missing nuanced opinions, specific complaints, or unexpected positive experiences that do not fit into the survey's categories. Passengers cannot spontaneously express their feelings as they occur, which might be crucial for understanding the immediate context of their satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

Finally, traditional surveys struggle to effectively capture spatio-temporal characteristics of transit satisfaction. While questions might ask about satisfaction with a specific route or station, they rarely allow for the precise linking of sentiment to a particular location at a specific time, or to a sequence of events within a journey. The "door-to-door" experience, as discussed by Abenoza et al. (2018), involves multiple legs and transitions, and surveys may not adequately capture how satisfaction aggregates across these dynamic elements. This limitation makes it difficult to pinpoint exact locations or times where service quality issues are most pronounced, hindering targeted interventions. For instance, while Inturri et al. (2021) explored correlations between PT accessibility, user satisfaction, and PT ridership using web surveys and spatial analysis, the data collection itself was still survey-based, limiting real-time, granular spatiotemporal insights.

In summary, while survey-based methods have laid a foundational understanding of transit satisfaction, their inherent limitations in terms of cost, timeliness, sample representativeness, and capacity to capture dynamic, spatio-temporal nuances necessitate the exploration of alternative, more agile, and comprehensive data sources.


## 2. Travel Satisfaction Analysis Using Social Media Data

The advent and widespread adoption of social media platforms have ushered in a new era for understanding public sentiment, including the complex domain of transit satisfaction. Unlike the structured and often retrospective nature of surveys, social media data offers a continuous, real-time stream of unsolicited, spontaneous feedback from a vast and diverse user base. This paradigm shift in data availability has spurred significant research into leveraging these digital footprints to gauge and analyze passenger experiences with public transportation.

The primary advantage of social media data over traditional survey methods lies in its unprecedented scale and real-time availability. As highlighted by Collins et al. (2013a), social media platforms like Twitter provide "vast amounts of performance metrics" that are "customer-based," offering a stark contrast to the "one-sided" business-centric metrics traditionally available to transit authorities. This real-time aspect allows for immediate monitoring of public opinion, enabling transit agencies to detect and respond to issues as they unfold, rather than waiting for periodic survey results. For instance, Al-Sahar et al. (2023) demonstrated how Twitter data could be used to gauge customer response to a major transit service change, comparing expressed satisfaction with measured service reliability in real-time. This dynamic feedback loop is invaluable for agile operational adjustments and crisis management.

Furthermore, social media data is cost-effective and less labor-intensive compared to manual surveys (Al-Sahar et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2019). Once the data collection and processing pipelines are established, the continuous flow of information requires minimal human intervention, significantly reducing the overhead associated with traditional data collection. This economic efficiency allows for more frequent and comprehensive analyses, providing a richer, more granular understanding of passenger sentiment over time. The sheer volume of data available on platforms like Twitter or Sina Weibo (a major Chinese social media platform) means that researchers can access a much larger and potentially more representative sample of opinions than typically feasible with surveys. Liu et al. (2019), for example, analyzed over 25,900 comments on websites regarding public transportation services in Shanghai, a scale that would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming with traditional survey methods.

Another significant advantage is the spontaneity and authenticity of feedback. Social media users often express their opinions freely and without prompting, providing raw, unfiltered insights into their experiences. This contrasts with surveys where responses might be influenced by the survey design, leading questions, or social desirability bias. The natural language used in social media posts can capture nuances and specific details that might be missed in structured survey questions. M'endez et al. (2019) emphasized that their Twitter-based methodology could capture the satisfaction of a "large mass of users" and "diagnose problems in a timely manner," identifying trends and issues related to bus operating firms more effectively than surveys which tend to produce average answers.

The ability to infer spatio-temporal context from social media data, albeit with challenges, represents a significant leap forward. While traditional surveys struggle to link sentiment precisely to a location and time, social media posts often contain geotags, timestamps, or explicit mentions of locations and events. Luo & He (2020), for instance, utilized Sina Weibo data related to the Shenzhen metro system to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of perceptions of metro services. They identified clear temporal variations among different service attributes (e.g., crowdedness, waiting times) across hours, days, and weekdays, and revealed spatial clusters of reports around central business districts and transport hubs. Similarly, Luo & He (2021) investigated gender differences in perceptions toward transit services across space and time using Weibo microblogs, demonstrating how location-based social media data can offer insights into gendered attitudes and their spatio-temporal variations. Zeng et al. (2024) also employed social media data analysis to assess passenger sentiment across multimodal railway hubs in Eastern China, revealing insights into factors influencing satisfaction beyond travel efficiency, such as signage quality and facility availability, and underscoring the importance of real-time data analytics.


Furthermore, social media offers the potential for uncovering latent issues and unexpected insights. Users might discuss problems or positive experiences that were not anticipated by survey designers, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the service landscape. El-Diraby et al. (2019) investigated the triangulation of social, semantic, and sentiment analyses of Twitter interactions to support modeling transit customers' satisfaction, demonstrating how social network analysis can reveal sub-communities and the evolution of discussions, offering insights into opinion dynamics that surveys cannot capture.

Despite these compelling advantages, the utilization of social media data for transit satisfaction analysis is not without its significant research gaps and limitations, particularly when relying on traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Firstly, a major challenge is the accuracy of identifying transit-relevant posts. Traditional approaches often rely on keyword filtering, where posts containing specific terms like "bus," "train," "metro," or "transit" are collected. However, as the abstract for TranSenti highlights, "the data obtained through keyword filtering may not necessarily be related to travel or transit services." A tweet mentioning "missed the bus to work" is clearly transit-related, but "my life is a train wreck" or "I'm on the bus to success" are not, despite containing transit-related keywords. This leads to a high volume of noise and irrelevant data, diluting the accuracy of sentiment analysis and requiring extensive manual cleaning or sophisticated filtering mechanisms. The challenge lies in distinguishing between incidental mentions of transit services and actual passenger experiences or feedback about the service itself. This problem is implicitly acknowledged by studies that attempt to refine their data, such as Al-Sahar et al. (2023) developing a "transit-specific sentiment lexicon" to improve accuracy, suggesting that generic keyword filtering and sentiment models are insufficient.

Secondly, even when relevant posts are identified, generic sentiment models often lack domain-specific adaptation to transit contexts, limiting their accuracy in evaluating passengers' transit satisfaction. The sentiment expressed in a general context might differ significantly from its meaning in a transit-specific context. For example, "slow" might be neutral in a general conversation but highly negative when describing a bus service. Terms like "delay," "crowded," or "on-time" carry specific connotations within the transit domain that generic sentiment lexicons or models may not fully capture. This issue was directly addressed by Al-Sahar et al. (2023), who found that their transit-specific lexicon "outperformed generic sentiment lexicons traditionally used in transit studies with regard to both accuracy (18.4%) and F1-score (7.1%)," underscoring the critical need for domain adaptation. Liu et al. (2019), while using NLP techniques including sentiment analysis, still had to interpret "anomalies of the results by tracing the context around the keywords," indicating the limitations of even advanced traditional NLP in fully grasping nuanced transit-specific sentiment without deeper contextual understanding.


Thirdly, and critically, traditional social media analysis fails to adequately consider the spatiotemporal characteristics of transit in a comprehensive and integrated manner for satisfaction analysis. While some studies, like Luo & He (2020) and Luo & He (2021), have made strides in exploring spatio-temporal dynamics by visualizing microblog data across different time scales and identifying spatial clusters, their methods primarily involve aggregating sentiment after it has been classified, rather than integrating spatio-temporal context into the sentiment classification process itself. The challenge is not just knowing where and when a post was made, but understanding how the specific location and time (e.g., peak hour, specific station, weather conditions) influence the expressed sentiment. A complaint about "crowdedness" during rush hour at a major transfer hub carries different implications than the same complaint during off-peak hours at a less busy stop. Traditional sentiment models, even with spatio-temporal metadata, struggle to embed these complex operational dynamics into their analysis. The abstract for TranSenti explicitly identifies this gap, stating that existing methods "fail to consider the spatiotemporal characteristics of transit."

In essence, while social media data offers a goldmine of information, the current analytical tools, largely based on keyword matching and generic sentiment models, are insufficient to fully unlock its potential for nuanced, context-aware transit satisfaction analysis. The noise from irrelevant posts, the lack of domain specificity in sentiment interpretation, and the inability to deeply integrate spatio-temporal operational dynamics remain significant hurdles, paving the way for more advanced computational approaches.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

The limitations inherent in traditional survey methods and the persistent challenges in effectively leveraging social media data for transit satisfaction analysis, particularly concerning accurate content filtering, domain-specific sentiment interpretation, and spatio-temporal contextualization, underscore a critical need for more advanced analytical tools. This is precisely where Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as a transformative solution, offering unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning that can directly address the identified research gaps. The introduction of LLMs into this domain stems from their demonstrated prowess in handling complex, unstructured textual data and their ability to learn nuanced patterns from vast corpora, far surpassing the capabilities of keyword-based filters or generic, lexicon-driven sentiment models.

LLMs, such as those discussed by Zheng et al. (2023) and Yan et al. (2025), represent a paradigm shift in natural language processing. Their core advantage lies in their profound contextual understanding (Feng et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2024). Unlike simpler NLP techniques that rely on keyword matching or rule-based systems, LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, enabling them to grasp the semantic meaning, intent, and emotional tone of language, even when expressed implicitly, sarcastically, or through complex sentence structures. This capability is crucial for accurately interpreting the diverse and often informal language found in social media posts related to transit. For instance, an LLM can differentiate between a post about a "bus" in a movie review and a post complaining about a "bus" being late, a distinction that a keyword filter would struggle with. This deep semantic understanding allows LLMs to act as a highly effective, hybrid filtering mechanism that goes beyond simple keywords, as envisioned by TranSenti, ensuring that only truly transit-relevant posts are analyzed.


Furthermore, LLMs offer significant advantages in domain adaptation and fine-tuning. While generic sentiment models often fall short in specialized contexts, LLMs can be fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets, allowing them to learn the unique lexicon, common phrases, and nuanced expressions prevalent in transit-related discourse (Feng et al., 2024). This fine-tuning process enables them to achieve higher accuracy in sentiment classification within the transit domain, overcoming the limitations of generic models that might misinterpret transit-specific jargon or operational terms. The ability of LLMs to perform tasks with minimal or even zero-shot learning is another profound advantage, significantly reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming manual annotation of large datasets, a common bottleneck in traditional machine learning approaches (Chen et al., 2024; Mo et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2025). This means that even with limited labeled transit-specific data, an LLM can begin to perform complex sentiment analysis tasks with remarkable proficiency.

Beyond mere classification, LLMs possess strong reasoning and explanatory capabilities, which can provide interpretable insights for transit authorities (Chen et al., 2024; Mo et al., 2023; Ruan et al., 2024). They can not only predict sentiment but also offer explanations for their predictions, highlighting the specific phrases or contexts that led to a particular sentiment classification. This interpretability is invaluable for transit agencies seeking to understand the root causes of passenger dissatisfaction rather than just knowing that dissatisfaction exists. For example, an LLM could identify that negative sentiment is specifically tied to "overcrowding on the 8 AM express bus" rather than just "crowding" in general.

The application of LLMs in transportation research is a rapidly emerging field, with several recent studies exploring their potential. Zheng et al. (2023) provided an early vision of how LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, could revolutionize intelligent transportation systems, highlighting their ability to handle traffic data from various modalities and execute transportation operations. This paper emphasized the potential of NLP combined with cross-modal processing for applications like crash report auto-generation and analysis. More directly related to travel behavior, Mo et al. (2023) proposed using LLMs for travel behavior prediction, specifically mode choice, through prompt engineering. Their results showed that LLM-based predictions achieved competitive accuracy with canonical supervised learning methods, even without training samples, and could output reasons for their predictions, albeit with some logical inconsistencies or hallucinations. This demonstrated the LLM's capacity for complex decision-making in a transportation context.

Further exploring LLM capabilities, Syed et al. (2024) benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in solving undergraduate-level transportation engineering problems, assessing their accuracy, consistency, and reasoning behaviors. Their TransportBench dataset revealed impressive accuracy but also unexpected inconsistent behaviors, suggesting that while powerful, LLMs require careful evaluation for specific transportation challenges. A study by Ruan et al. (2024) is particularly pertinent, as it introduced a novel methodological framework utilizing LLMs to infer mentioned travel modes and reason about people's attitudes towards associated travel modes from Twitter posts, crucially, without the need for manual annotation. This work identified contributing factors to negative sentiments, aligning closely with the goals of transit satisfaction analysis. Similarly, Chen et al. (2024) proposed DelayPTC-LLM for metro passenger travel choice prediction under train delays, leveraging LLMs' strengths in handling complex, sparse datasets and providing interpretable insights into passenger flow redistribution during disruptions. This highlights LLMs' utility in dynamic, real-world operational scenarios.


In the broader context of service quality evaluation, Feng et al. (2024) introduced an innovative method for evaluating tourism service quality using LLMs and aspect-based sentiment analysis of travelogue data. By leveraging LLMs' advanced capabilities for nuanced sentiment recognition at the aspect level, their research significantly enhanced the understanding of customer sentiments towards various tourism services, demonstrating the LLM's power in processing large volumes of unstructured data for service quality assessment in a related domain. Furthermore, Jonnala et al. (2025) explored the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation management, focusing on optimizing route planning, reducing wait times, and providing personalized travel assistance using GTFS and other relevant data, showcasing LLMs' role in operational decision-making. A comprehensive review by Yan et al. (2025) synthesized the methodologies and applications of LLMs in traffic and transportation research, highlighting their ability to process unstructured textual data for advancements in areas like travel behavior prediction and general transportation queries, and identifying critical research gaps and future opportunities for integrating LLMs with existing tools and refining architectures.

Despite these promising advancements and the clear advantages of LLMs in handling complex textual data and performing nuanced sentiment analysis, a significant research gap remains: the specific application of LLMs to transit satisfaction analysis from social media, with a deep and integrated consideration of spatio-temporal operational dynamics, is largely unexplored. While LLMs have been shown to understand context and perform sentiment analysis in general or related domains, and some studies have explored spatio-temporal aspects of social media data, the explicit fusion of LLM capabilities with the intricate, real-time spatiotemporal context of transit operations for satisfaction assessment is still in its nascent stages.

The challenge lies not just in identifying sentiment, but in linking that sentiment precisely to specific transit events, locations, and times, and understanding how operational factors (e.g., a bus being 15 minutes late at a particular stop during rush hour, or a station being unusually crowded due to a special event) influence passenger satisfaction. Existing LLM applications in transportation, while impressive, often focus on broader tasks like travel behavior prediction or general traffic safety, or on operational optimization without a direct, fine-grained link to passenger sentiment in a spatio-temporal context. The development of a "hybrid LLM-driven filtering mechanism to accurately identify transit-relevant posts" that goes beyond simple semantic understanding to truly capture the essence of a passenger's experience, and a "fine-tuned spatio-temporal sentiment classification model to assess satisfaction by embedding transit-specific operational dynamics," as proposed by TranSenti, represents a critical next step. This involves training or fine-tuning LLMs not just on language, but on the logic and patterns of transit operations, enabling them to interpret sentiments within the precise framework of real-world service delivery. The potential for LLMs to capture subtle passenger sentiments by considering factors like peak-hour service conditions and location-specific issues, thereby supporting data-driven decision-making for transit authorities, remains a largely untapped frontier in transportation research.
