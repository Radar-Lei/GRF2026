# Barriers to Women’s Mobility in Metro Transit: Uncovering Gendered Experiences Through Social Media Analytics

# Abstract

Urbanization has significantly enhanced transport infrastructure and mobility in cities worldwide, with a growing number of cities either operating or planning metro systems. However, advanced public transport systems like metros do not equally serve all population groups. The literature on transport equity highlights that different social strata benefit unevenly from transit services. Women, in particular, often face unique mobility challenges compared to men. Many of these challenges—such as voyeurism, sexual harassment, and the lack of respect for breastfeeding—are underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma. As a result, they remain largely invisible to passengers, operators, and policymakers, receiving limited attention in mainstream media. This issue is especially pronounced in developing countries, where inadequate surveillance and policing further exacerbate the problem. To address this critical gap, the proposed research will employ a social media analytics approach to capture and analyze unspoken, real-world experiences of women in metro systems globally. Theoretically, this study contributes to the discourse on transport equity by highlighting gendered barriers to mobility. Methodologically, it introduces a novel application of social media analytics in transport research. Empirically, it will create a unique dataset of genderspecific metro experiences across diverse urban contexts. Practically, the findings will provide policymakers and transit operators with actionable insights to enhance safety, inclusivity, and equity in metro systems.

Achieving transport equity requires addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged groups, including women. A safer and more inclusive travel experience can boost women’s mobility, empowering them to access employment, education, and social opportunities both within and beyond their cities. From a societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit not only enhances their well-being but also supports broader goals of social inclusion and gender equality. In advanced economies such as Japan and Hong Kong, urban metros form the backbone of the transport network, handling the majority of daily trips. Yet even in these systems, women often feel unsafe, particularly during nighttime or in sparsely populated areas and on less-frequented lines. Conversely, in cities where metros play a smaller role and public transport usage is lower, reduced passenger volumes do not automatically translate into increased safety. In fact, limited public surveillance can heighten women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts. By systematically tackling these challenges, this research will deepen our understanding of gender and mobility, inform evidence-based interventions, and ultimately help create safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole.

We propose a groundbreaking approach that harnesses social media data to uncover gendered experiences in metro systems across a wide range of global cities. Using keywords like “metro” and related terms in multiple languages, we will collect and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. Guided by a set of predefined service quality dimensions—with a specific focus on safety—we will apply sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to compare and contrast the experiences of women and men. To gain deeper insights, we will conduct case studies in three Asian cities—tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul. In these cities, we will explore how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors. By mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces, we aim to reveal how perceived or experienced barriers limit their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities. This mixedmethod approach combines large-scale digital data with urban transport research to generate actionable knowledge about gendered mobility barriers.

Our solution advances existing approaches to transport equity in three key ways: (1) Leveraging social media analytics: By mining and analyzing vast amounts of social media data, we can uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit—especially in developing countries where official reporting is scarce. By carefully selecting cities across varying income levels (measured by GDP per capita) and gender inequality indices, we will gain a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers. (2) Developing customized language models: We will build our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. (3) Integrating digital analytics with case studies: Through in-depth case studies in three Asian cities, we will complement our large-scale data analysis with focused group discussions. This mixed-method approach will allow us to directly link women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. Together, these innovations will yield richer, more actionable insights than traditional surveys or qualitative studies alone, advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

# 1. Introduction

The rapid pace of urbanization across the globe has led to significant investments in urban transport infrastructure, with metro systems emerging as a cornerstone of modern city planning. These advanced public transport networks are designed to enhance connectivity, reduce congestion, and facilitate economic activity, promising a more mobile and accessible urban environment for all residents. However, the benefits of such sophisticated systems are not uniformly distributed across all segments of the population. A substantial body of literature on transport equity consistently demonstrates that different social strata experience and benefit from transit services in profoundly unequal ways. Among these diverse groups, women frequently encounter distinct and often more severe mobility challenges compared to their male counterparts, a disparity that has profound implications for their access to employment, education, and social opportunities (Panjwani, 2018; Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020).

The unique mobility challenges faced by women in public transit, particularly within metro systems, are multifaceted and deeply rooted in societal structures. These challenges extend beyond mere logistical inconveniences to encompass issues of personal safety, respect, and freedom from harassment. Instances of voyeurism, sexual harassment, and a general lack of respect for women, including those breastfeeding, are pervasive yet notoriously underreported. This underreporting is a complex phenomenon, driven by a confluence of social norms that often normalize such behaviors, cultural pressures that discourage public disclosure, and a pervasive fear of stigma or retaliation. Consequently, these critical issues remain largely invisible to the very stakeholders who are in a position to effect change: fellow passengers, transit operators, and policymakers. Mainstream media, too, often overlooks these experiences, further entrenching their invisibility. The problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where inadequate surveillance infrastructure, insufficient policing, and weaker legal frameworks exacerbate women’s vulnerability and diminish their sense of security in public spaces (Asha et al., 2024; King et al., 2021; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018).

This pervasive invisibility represents a critical gap in our understanding of urban mobility and transport equity. Traditional research methods, such as surveys and official incident reports, often fail to capture the nuanced, everyday experiences of fear, discomfort, and harassment that shape women’s travel behaviors. To address this profound limitation, the proposed research champions a novel social media analytics approach. By systematically collecting and analyzing user-generated content from social media platforms, this study aims to uncover the unspoken, real-world experiences of women navigating metro systems across a diverse array of global cities. This methodological innovation promises to shed light on the hidden dimensions of gendered mobility barriers, providing a more comprehensive and authentic portrayal of women’s interactions with public transit.

Theoretically, this study makes a significant contribution to the ongoing discourse on transport equity by foregrounding gendered barriers to mobility as a central concern. It moves beyond a purely quantitative assessment of access to delve into the qualitative and affective dimensions of travel, recognizing that perceived safety and comfort are as crucial as physical accessibility (Ouali et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2024). Methodologically, the research introduces a pioneering application of social media analytics, complemented by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), within the domain of transport research. This approach offers a scalable and dynamic means of gathering insights that are often inaccessible through conventional methods. Empirically, the study is poised to generate a unique and invaluable dataset of gender-specific metro experiences, spanning diverse urban contexts and cultural landscapes. This dataset will serve as a rich resource for future research and comparative analyses. Practically, the anticipated findings will furnish policymakers and transit operators with actionable insights, enabling them to design and implement targeted interventions aimed at enhancing safety, fostering inclusivity, and promoting genuine equity within metro systems worldwide. Ultimately, by empowering women with safer and more inclusive travel experiences, this research contributes to broader societal goals of gender equality and social inclusion, unlocking

their potential to fully participate in urban life and access a wider spectrum of opportunities.

# 2. The Gendered Landscape of Urban Mobility and Public Transit

The concept of mobility is fundamental to urban life, enabling access to employment, education, healthcare, and social networks. However, the experience of mobility is far from universal, being profoundly shaped by an individual’s gender, socioeconomic status, and cultural context. For women, urban mobility is often circumscribed by a unique set of challenges that limit their freedom, choices, and overall participation in public life. These challenges are not merely incidental but are deeply embedded in historical, economic, and social structures, creating a gendered landscape of urban movement that warrants critical examination.

# 2.1 Historical and Socio-Cultural Roots of Restricted Women’s Mobility

Historically, societal norms have often imposed restrictions on women’s freedom of movement, particularly in public spaces. Becker’s seminal work (Becker, 2019) explores the economic origins of customs aimed at restricting women’s sexuality, such as limitations on their freedom of mobility. This research, drawing on within-country variation across 500,000 women in 34 countries, demonstrates a significant correlation between historically pastoral societies and more restrictive norms concerning women’s promiscuity and mobility. The mechanism identified is male absence, rather than male dominance per se, suggesting that heightened paternity uncertainty in pastoral contexts led to larger payoffs for imposing restrictions on women’s sexuality and movement. While this study focuses on pre-industrial subsistence, its findings underscore the deep historical roots of gendered mobility restrictions, highlighting how deeply ingrained cultural and social norms can shape women’s access to public spaces, including modern transport systems. These historical precedents continue to manifest in contemporary urban environments, influencing perceptions of appropriate female behavior and the safety of women in public.

In many societies, particularly in the Global South, conservative norms and high crime rates further amplify restrictions on women’s physical mobility, directly impacting their labor market opportunities. Field and Vyborny (Field & Vyborny, 2022) provide experimental evidence from Lahore, Pakistan, demonstrating that reducing physical mobility constraints has a substantial impact on job searching for women, including those not actively seeking employment at baseline. Crucially, their findings indicate that women’s response is primarily driven by access to a women-only transport service, suggesting that safety and social acceptability, rather than merely the cost of transport, constitute key barriers. This highlights a critical distinction: while economic factors are often considered primary, the psychological and social dimensions of safety and acceptability are paramount for women’s mobility, particularly in contexts where gendered norms are more pronounced. The implication is that simply providing transport is insufficient; it must be safe and socially acceptable for women to truly benefit.

# 2.2 Specific Challenges in Public Transport: Safety, Harassment, and Fear

Public transport, despite its potential to democratize access to urban opportunities, frequently becomes a site where gendered inequalities are acutely experienced. Women consistently report higher levels of fear and insecurity in public transport environments compared to men, even in countries with strong reputations for gender equality. Lindkvist (Lindkvist, 2024), for instance, reveals that despite Sweden’s political commitment to gender equality, women continue to fear traveling by public transport and being out in the evenings. Her qualitative interviews and analysis of national statistics show that women’s travel choices are significantly affected by safety concerns, leading to necessary adaptations in their mobility strategies. This suggests that patriarchal norms, which delimit women’s use and access to public space, persist even in seemingly advanced societies, challenging the “mythical mantra” of gender equality.

The perception of safety is not merely a subjective feeling but is often rooted in real experiences or the credible threat of gender-based violence and harassment. Ouali et al. (Ouali et al., 2020) conducted a large-scale study using customer satisfaction data for 28 world cities, revealing a significant gender gap in the perception of safety, with women being $10 \%$ more likely than men to feel unsafe in metros (and $6 \%$ in buses). This gap is more pronounced for safety than for overall satisfaction, underscoring its distinct importance. Their findings also indicate that more acts of violence, larger carriages, and emptier vehicles decrease women’s feeling of safety, suggesting specific environmental factors that contribute to insecurity. This quantitative evidence is strongly supported by numerous qualitative studies that delve into the distressing realities of women’s experiences.

In Bangladesh, sexual violence on public transportation is highlighted as a significant threat to women’s mobility and dignity, yet it remains largely invisible due to high rates of underreporting (Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018). This invisibility not only confines women’s lives but also fosters a hostile environment that impedes their empowerment. King et al. (King et al., 2021) further elaborate on this, analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from 200 women in Bangladesh. Their findings reveal that women face multiple threats, including gender-based violence, harassment, crime, and traffic-related injuries, leading to high levels of anxiety and fear. Despite these dangers, women are often “captive travelers,” forced to prioritize price and availability over safety, and consequently resort to mitigating risks by altering travel patterns and restricting travel frequency. This demonstrates a profound lack of mobility justice, where women’s fundamental right to safe transport is compromised.

Similar patterns are observed in other developing contexts. Infante-Vargas and Boyer (Infante-Vargas & Boyer, 2021) detail the pervasiveness of gender-based violence (GBV) against women using public transport in Saltillo, Mexico. Through a mixed-method approach, they uncover that GBV is an everyday reality, leading to re-victimization and significant psychological, financial, and emotional repercussions that extend beyond the immediate event, severely limiting women’s mobility. Busco et al. (Busco et al., 2022) corroborate this in Santiago, Chile, finding a high perception of insecurity in public transport for both men and women, but significantly greater among women, older people, and national citizens. They emphasize the need for a permanent scan on security issues, considering a complete set of variables beyond general crime, such as fear of harassment, discrimination, and street protests.

The emotional and affective dimensions of these experiences are also crucial. Roy et al. (Roy et al., 2024) explore the affects and emotions of everyday commutes for women in Kolkata, India. Using in-depth interviews and visual surveys, they move beyond simply identifying barriers to understand how affects and emotions shape accessibility, acceptability, and affordability. They argue that the disruptive affects of overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable conditions produce emotional ordeals, compelling women to adjust, accept, or even opt out of public transport. This highlights the entangled nature of affects, emotions, reactions, and consequences in shaping gendered mobility inequalities. Chowdhury’s ethnographic account of male transport workers in Kolkata (Shakthi, 2024) further illuminates the gendered dynamics of public space, showing how masculinities and everyday morality reinforce a heteronormative city, contributing to women’s insecurity.

Beyond direct harassment, women also engage in extensive “safety work” to navigate public transport. Ison et al. (Ison et al., 2024) reveal through interviews with women and gender-diverse people in Australia that they constantly change their behavior, strategize, and plan to stay safe. This safety work is time-consuming and stressful, yet often necessary due to the prevalence of sexual violence and harassment on public transport. Their earlier work (Ison et al., 2023) further emphasizes that while significant experiences of sexual violence are reported, it is the “everyday” experiences across their life course that profoundly impact how they travel and their confidence. These studies collectively argue for primary prevention of gender-based violence and significant changes to public transport systems to reduce the burden of safety work on women.

The role of bystanders is also critical in shaping women’s perception of security. Tilleman and Chowdhury (Tilleman & Chowdhury, 2024) investigate how the presence of bystanders influences women’s sense of security and self-efficacy on public transport in Auckland, New Zealand. Their survey findings suggest that bystander and community support is an important expectation for women, affecting their perception of security. They advocate for strengthening anti-harassment strategies by building an active bystander community and bolstering support for vulnerable riders, thereby establishing harassment as an unacceptable form of passenger behavior.

# 2.3 Time Poverty and Access to Opportunities

The challenges to women’s mobility extend beyond safety to encompass issues of time poverty and access to essential urban opportunities. Zehba M. P. et al. (Zehba M. P. et al., 2025) explore time poverty and women’s urban mobility narratives in Kochi, India, highlighting how societal expectations of balancing work and gender roles disproportionately affect urban women. Their qualitative analysis reveals that entrenched gender roles burden women with unpaid domestic and caregiving responsibilities, leading to severe time poverty exacerbated by travel constraints and limited access to transport services. This significantly impacts their quality of life and access to employment and other opportunities, particularly for low-income working women. Sagaris and TiznadoAitken (Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020) echo this, emphasizing the importance of

considering non-work trip purposes and better land-use combinations to accommodate care-oriented trips for women in Santiago, Chile. They argue that barriers linked to unsafe public transport environments limit women’s mobility, thereby restricting their participation in various spheres. While women may account for a disproportionately high number of walking trips, which could be interpreted as ‘greater sustainability,’ this often masks significant inequalities in access and can come at a high social cost.

The cumulative effect of these barriers—fear of harassment, actual experiences of violence, the burden of safety work, and time poverty—significantly restricts women’s access to employment, education, and social opportunities. Asha et al. (Asha et al., 2024) investigate Global South women’s challenges in public transport to inform autonomous vehicle (AV) design, revealing distressing experiences of abuse and undertaken safety measures among Bangladeshi women. Their co-design sessions suggest prioritizing women’s safety through equitable AV design over current, often ineffective, retributive justice. This highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions that directly address women’s safety concerns to unlock their full mobility potential.

# 2.4 Limitations of Traditional Research and the Need for New Approaches

The extensive body of literature reviewed above, while crucial, predominantly relies on traditional qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, ethnographic studies) and quantitative surveys. While these methods provide rich, in-depth insights into women’s experiences and perceptions, they often suffer from limitations in terms of scale, realtime applicability, and the ability to capture underreported incidents. The very nature of gendered violence and harassment, coupled with social norms and fear of stigma, means that many experiences remain “unspoken” and are not captured through formal reporting mechanisms or even direct questioning in surveys (Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018). This creates a significant blind spot for policymakers and operators, who may be unaware of the true extent and nature of the challenges faced by women.

Moreover, traditional methods can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to conduct large-scale, cross-cultural comparative studies or to monitor changes in real-time. The need for more dynamic, scalable, and unobtrusive methods to capture these hidden narratives is therefore paramount. This gap underscores the potential of social media analytics, combined with advanced natural language processing and large language models, to provide a complementary and powerful lens through which to uncover the nuanced, gendered experiences of women in metro transit, moving beyond the limitations of conventional approaches.

# 3. Social Media Analytics as a Tool for Urban and Transport Research

The proliferation of social media platforms has transformed the landscape of public communication, generating an unprecedented volume of user-generated content that reflects real-time sentiments, opinions, and experiences. This vast digital footprint offers a powerful, albeit complex, data source for researchers seeking to understand societal phenomena, public perceptions, and the dynamics of urban life. Social Media Analytics (SMA) has emerged as a critical methodology to harness this data, providing insights that complement or even surpass those obtainable through traditional research methods.

# 3.1 General Capabilities and Applications of Social Media Analytics

SMA encompasses a range of techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from social media platforms to extract meaningful patterns and insights. Its utility spans diverse fields, from public opinion polling to disaster response and market research. Thelwall (Thelwall, 2017) provides a critical evaluation of SMA for YouTube comments, demonstrating its potential to identify plausible patterns of subtopic difference, gender, and sentiment. This work highlights the exploratory, multi-method nature of SMA, acknowledging both its strengths in uncovering nuanced patterns and its inherent limitations, such as data noise and representativeness. Despite these challenges, SMA offers a unique window into unsolicited public discourse, capturing authentic expressions that might not surface in structured surveys.

One of the most compelling applications of SMA lies in its capacity to provide real-time information and gauge public sentiment during critical events. Sufi (Sufi, 2023) underscores the imperative of utilizing social media data to comprehend critical insights on the Russia–Ukraine cyber conflict, citing its unparalleled capacity for real-time information dissemination and tracking of cyber incidents. By leveraging advanced monitoring tools and NLP algorithms, this study generated detailed multilingual cyber intelligence reports, demonstrating SMA’s power in complex, rapidly evolving situations. Similarly, Yigitcanlar et al. (Yigitcanlar et al., 2020) explore how SMA can assist authorities in pandemic-related policy decisions, using systematic geo-Twitter analysis during COVID-19 in Australia. Their findings reveal that SMA is an efficient approach to capture public attitudes and perceptions, guiding interventions and decisions when direct public consultations are impractical. These studies collectively illustrate SMA’s ability to provide timely, large-scale insights into public perceptions and behaviors, making it an invaluable tool for policy-making and crisis management.

The methodological advancements in SMA are continuously evolving, with deep learning (DL) playing an increasingly central role. Hayat et al. (Hayat et al., 2019) discuss the prospects of deep learning in SMA, noting its significant processing power for tasks like speech, image, or text processing. They present a taxonomy-oriented summary of practiced DL architectures, emphasizing SMA-oriented problems with DL-based solutions. This highlights how DL can overcome the challenges of analyzing the vast, heterogeneous, and multimodal data generated on social media, addressing issues like scalability and complexity. More recent work by Alharbi and Haq (Alharbi & Haq, 2024) demonstrates the effectiveness of advanced transformer models like DistilBERT in classifying disaster-related tweets, achieving high predictive accuracy. This underscores the potential of DL-enhanced SMA to contribute to better public safety and emergency preparedness by efficiently analyzing social media data. Furthermore, S. et al. (S et al., 2025) advocate for an architecture that unifies NLP for text-based content and deep learning for visual data into emotion categorization, recognizing the multimodal nature of user-generated content. Their proposed framework, integrating EfficientNet for visual inputs and GPT-2 (optimized with LoRA) for text, aims to extract maximum potential from social media knowledge, transforming emotion analytics.

# 3.2 Application of Social Media Analytics in Transport Research

Within the domain of transport research, SMA offers a transformative approach to understanding customer satisfaction, service quality, and public perceptions, moving beyond the limitations of traditional surveys. Luo and He (Luo & He, 2020) propose a framework for integrating quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate perceptions of transport services by mining Sina Weibo data related to the Shenzhen metro system. Their study effectively categorizes semantic, spatial, and temporal information, identifying service attributes specific to the Chinese context and revealing clear temporal and spatial variations in perceptions of crowdedness, waiting times, reliability, frequency, safety, and personnel behavior. This demonstrates SMA’s capacity to provide granular insights into service performance from the customer’s perspective, enabling more effective monitoring and management of metro systems.

Further elaborating on this, Luo and He (Luo & He, 2021) specifically investigate gendered attitudes toward transit services in Shenzhen using Weibo microblogs. Their findings reveal a distinct gender gap in terms of posting quantity, with women being more concerned about the comfort of the transit environment (e.g., temperature, crowdedness, and safety, especially at night), while men tend to focus on e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. This study presents a robust methodological framework for utilizing social media mining techniques to investigate gendered, subjective travel experiences, offering an innovative way for practitioners to gather customer service feedback and build more inclusive service systems.

Building on these insights, Luo et al. (Luo et al., 2023) explore influential factors in customer satisfaction of transit services, leveraging crowdsourced data to capture heterogeneity across individuals, space, and time. They apply sentiment analysis to measure customer satisfaction across various service attributes (safety, crowdedness, reliability, personnel behavior, and comfort) and use a beta regression model to identify explanatory factors. Their results indicate that age, gender, travel mode, time, and space significantly contribute to customer satisfaction, with varying impacts on different service attributes. Crucially, this study also reveals the highly polarized nature of online sentiment, explaining gendered attitudes, and underscores the potential of SMA to inform market segment analysis and policy decision-making in the transport sector.

While these studies highlight the immense potential of SMA in transport research, particularly for understanding customer satisfaction and gendered perceptions, they also implicitly point to some limitations. The reliance on traditional NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, while effective, may struggle with the nuances, sarcasm, and implicit meanings often present in human language, especially across diverse cultural and linguistic contexts. Furthermore, the sheer volume and unstructured nature of social media data necessitate sophisticated processing capabilities to extract deep, actionable insights. This is where the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a significant advancement, promising to enhance the accuracy and depth of analysis in SMA, particularly for complex social issues like gendered mobility barriers.

# 4. The Emergence and Application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Data Analysis

The past few years have witnessed a revolutionary leap in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the advent and rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, characterized by their immense size, vast training datasets, and sophisticated transformer architectures, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding, generating, and processing human language. Their emergence has profound implications for social media analytics, offering advanced tools to extract more nuanced and contextually rich insights from unstructured textual data.

# 4.1 Overview of LLMs and Their Capabilities in NLP Tasks

LLMs, such as OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s BERT, and Meta’s LLaMA, are pretrained on massive corpora of text data, enabling them to learn intricate patterns of language, grammar, semantics, and even world knowledge. This pre-training allows them to perform a wide array of NLP tasks with remarkable proficiency, including text classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, translation, and question answering. Their core strength lies in their ability to generate contextualized embeddings, which are numerical representations of words or phrases that capture their meaning based on the surrounding text. This contrasts sharply with older NLP techniques that often relied on simpler, context-agnostic word embeddings or rule-based systems.

Radwan et al. (Radwan et al., 2024) exemplify the application of LLMs in mental health analytics, leveraging GPT-3 embeddings and machine learning algorithms to classify social media posts indicative of stress disorders. Their approach transformed posts into vector representations that captured semantic meaning and linguistic nuances, achieving an impressive $8 3 \%$ accuracy with a support vector machine model. This demonstrates how LLM embeddings can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification tasks by providing richer, more meaningful representations of textual data. The ability of LLMs to understand complex semantic relationships and subtle emotional cues makes them particularly well-suited for analyzing the subjective and often implicit expressions found in social media content.

Beyond mere classification, LLMs also possess generative capabilities, allowing them to produce coherent and contextually relevant text. Li et al. (Y. Li et al., 2023) developed ChatDoctor, a medical chat model fine-tuned on LLaMA using a large dataset of patientdoctor dialogues. By incorporating a self-directed information retrieval mechanism, ChatDoctor significantly improved its ability to understand patient needs and provide accurate medical advice. This highlights the potential of LLMs to not only analyze existing text but also to interact with users, synthesize information, and generate informed responses, which could be invaluable in understanding complex narratives and clarifying ambiguous statements in social media data.

Furthermore, LLMs are increasingly being integrated with other modalities, such as vision. Li et al. (J. Li et al., 2023) introduced BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from frozen image encoders and large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying

Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This multimodal capability is particularly relevant for social media analytics, where user-generated content often includes images and videos alongside text. The ability to process and understand the interplay between visual and textual information can provide a more holistic and accurate interpretation of user experiences, especially in contexts like public transport where visual cues (e.g., crowdedness, lighting, presence of certain individuals) are integral to perceived safety.

# 4.2 Enhancing Social Media Analysis with LLMs

The integration of LLMs into social media analytics offers several distinct advantages over traditional NLP techniques. Firstly, LLMs excel at nuanced sentiment analysis. Unlike rule-based or lexicon-based methods that might struggle with sarcasm, irony, or implicit negative sentiments, LLMs can often infer the underlying emotional tone and intent from complex linguistic structures. This is crucial for understanding subjective experiences like feeling “unsafe” or “uncomfortable,” which are often expressed indirectly on social media. For instance, a post stating “Another lovely evening on the metro, just me and a few questionable characters” might be flagged as neutral by a basic sentiment analyzer, but an LLM could infer a negative sentiment related to safety concerns.

Secondly, LLMs significantly improve multilingual processing. Social media content is inherently multilingual, especially when analyzing global phenomena. Building customized language models, as proposed in the abstract, allows for more accurate cleaning, processing, and interpretation of data across diverse cultural contexts. Traditional NLP often requires separate models or extensive feature engineering for each language, whereas LLMs, particularly those trained on vast multilingual datasets, can handle multiple languages more effectively, capturing cross-cultural nuances in expressions of fear, discomfort, or satisfaction. Sufi (Sufi, 2023) already demonstrated the power of multilingual analysis in the context of cyber warfare, and LLMs can elevate this capability further.

Thirdly, LLMs facilitate deeper thematic extraction and topic modeling. While traditional methods like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) can identify topics, LLMs can provide more coherent and semantically rich topic descriptions, and even identify subthemes or underlying narratives that might be missed by statistical approaches. This allows researchers to move beyond simple keyword counts to understand the why behind certain sentiments or experiences, such as the specific types of harassment or the particular circumstances that evoke feelings of unsafety.

Finally, LLMs can assist in handling data noise and ambiguity. Social media data is notoriously noisy, containing slang, abbreviations, misspellings, and incomplete sentences. LLMs, with their robust language understanding capabilities, are better equipped to interpret and make sense of such informal language, reducing the need for extensive manual data cleaning and improving the overall quality of analysis. Their ability to generate coherent summaries or explanations of complex textual data can also aid in the interpretation of findings, making the insights more accessible and actionable for policymakers.

However, the application of LLMs is not without its challenges. These models are computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. They can also perpetuate biases present in their training data, leading to potentially skewed interpretations if not carefully managed. Furthermore, while powerful, they still require careful prompting and validation to ensure that their outputs align with the research objectives and accurately reflect the human experiences they are designed to analyze. Despite these challenges, the transformative potential of LLMs to unlock deeper, more nuanced insights from social media data makes them an indispensable tool for addressing complex social issues like gendered mobility barriers in public transit.

# 5. Bridging the Gap: Social Media Analytics, LLMs, and Gendered Mobility

The preceding sections have established the pervasive and underreported nature of gendered barriers to women’s mobility in public transit, particularly in metro systems, and highlighted the transformative potential of social media analytics (SMA) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in urban and transport research. This section synthesizes these two domains, demonstrating how a novel integration of SMA and LLMs can effectively bridge the existing research gap, uncovering the unspoken realities of women’s experiences and providing actionable insights for transport equity.

# 5.1 Uncovering Underreported Experiences through Digital Traces

The fundamental challenge in understanding women’s mobility barriers lies in the pervasive underreporting of incidents like voyeurism, sexual harassment, and disrespect. As discussed by Mazumder and Pokharel (Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018) and King et al. (King et al., 2021), social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma prevent many women from formally reporting these experiences, rendering them invisible to official channels and traditional surveys. This is particularly acute in developing countries where institutional support and reporting mechanisms are often weak or mistrusted.

Social media platforms, however, provide an alternative space for individuals to share their experiences, vent frustrations, and seek solidarity, often in real-time and with a degree of anonymity that encourages disclosure. By mining and analyzing vast amounts of user-generated content, SMA can tap into this rich, unsolicited reservoir of real-world experiences. Luo and He’s work (Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021) has already demonstrated the utility of social media data in capturing gendered perceptions of transit services, revealing that women are more concerned about comfort and safety, especially at night. This foundational work indicates that social media is indeed a viable source for understanding gender-specific concerns. The proposed approach takes this a step further by specifically targeting the unspoken realities of harassment and fear, which are often expressed implicitly or through nuanced language.

The advantage of SMA here is its ability to capture spontaneous, unfiltered narratives that might not emerge in structured survey questions or interviews. While traditional qualitative studies provide depth (Ison et al., 2023, 2024; Roy et al., 2024), they are limited in scale. SMA offers the scale to identify widespread patterns and emerging issues across diverse urban contexts, especially in developing countries where official

reporting is scarce. By carefully selecting cities across varying income levels and gender inequality indices, a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers can be achieved, allowing for comparative analysis of how these issues manifest differently under varying socio-economic and cultural conditions.

# 5.2 Leveraging Customized Language Models for Nuanced Interpretation

The sheer volume, multilingual nature, and inherent noise of social media data pose significant analytical challenges. This is where the development and application of customized Large Language Models (LLMs) become a critical innovation. While existing LLMs like GPT-3 have shown promise in sentiment analysis and classification tasks (Radwan et al., 2024), a customized approach is essential for the specific domain of gendered mobility in public transit.

Customized LLMs can be fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets, including existing qualitative research on women’s experiences in public transport, to better understand the specific lexicon, slang, and implicit expressions related to safety, harassment, and discomfort. This fine-tuning allows the LLMs to move beyond generic sentiment analysis to a more nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. For instance, an LLM trained on relevant data could distinguish between general complaints about crowdedness and expressions of fear specifically linked to crowded conditions for women. It could also identify subtle cues of voyeurism or inappropriate behavior that might be overlooked by less sophisticated NLP models.

Furthermore, the ability of LLMs to handle multilingual data is paramount for a global study. By building LLMs capable of processing content in multiple languages, the research can overcome linguistic barriers that often limit the scope of traditional studies. This enables a deeper understanding of how women articulate their perceptions of safety in different cultural and linguistic frameworks, and how these articulations relate to actual travel behaviors. The capacity of LLMs to generate coherent summaries and extract key themes from vast amounts of unstructured text will be instrumental in making sense of the complex narratives uncovered, providing richer, more actionable insights than traditional methods alone. The work by S. et al. (S et al., 2025) on integrating NLP and deep learning for multimodal sentiment analysis further supports the idea that advanced models are necessary to capture the full spectrum of user-generated content.

# 5.3 Integrating Digital Analytics with Case Studies for Actionable Knowledge

While large-scale digital data analysis provides breadth, it benefits immensely from integration with in-depth qualitative methods to provide depth and contextual understanding. The proposed mixed-method approach, combining large-scale social media analytics with focused group discussions in three Asian cities (Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul), represents a powerful strategy for generating actionable knowledge.

The case studies will serve several critical functions: (1) Validation and Contextualization: The insights derived from social media analytics can be validated and contextualized through direct engagement with women in these cities. Focused group discussions will allow researchers to explore how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted within their specific cultural and urban

contexts, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors. This direct feedback loop is crucial for ensuring that the digital insights accurately reflect lived experiences and are not merely statistical artifacts. (2) Understanding Behavioral Impacts: By linking women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities, the case studies will reveal the tangible consequences of perceived or experienced barriers. This involves mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces, illustrating how fear or harassment can limit their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities, as highlighted by studies on time poverty and restricted mobility (Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020; Zehba M. P. et al., 2025). (3) Identifying Specific Interventions: The qualitative insights from the case studies can help identify specific, culturally appropriate interventions. For example, while social media might reveal a general sentiment of unsafety in crowded metro cars, focus groups could pinpoint whether this is due to specific types of harassment, lack of bystander intervention (Tilleman & Chowdhury, 2024), or inadequate staff presence, leading to more targeted policy recommendations.

This mixed-method approach overcomes the limitations of relying solely on either digital data or traditional qualitative studies. Digital analytics provides the scale and real-time insights into often-unspoken issues, while case studies provide the depth, validation, and contextual understanding necessary to translate these insights into effective policy and operational changes. The work by He et al. (He et al., 2023) on travel satisfaction in Hong Kong, a transit-oriented city, provides a relevant context for one of the proposed case studies, demonstrating the importance of understanding passenger perceptions in specific urban environments. By combining these methodologies, the research aims to yield richer, more actionable insights that advance both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

# 6. Conclusion

The literature review has underscored a critical and persistent challenge in urban mobility: the unique and often invisible barriers that women face in public transit, particularly within metro systems. Despite significant advancements in transport infrastructure globally, the promise of equitable access remains unfulfilled for many women. Traditional research methods, while valuable, have struggled to fully capture the pervasive yet underreported experiences of voyeurism, sexual harassment, and a general lack of safety that profoundly impact women’s mobility choices and access to urban opportunities. These issues are exacerbated in developing countries and persist even in advanced economies, highlighting a universal need for deeper understanding and targeted interventions.

The existing body of research provides a robust foundation for understanding the gendered landscape of urban mobility. Studies by Becker (Becker, 2019) and Field and Vyborny (Field & Vyborny, 2022) illuminate the historical and socio-cultural roots of women’s mobility restrictions, emphasizing that safety and social acceptability are often more critical than mere cost. Numerous qualitative and quantitative studies from diverse global contexts—including Kolkata (Roy et al., 2024; Shakthi, 2024), Sweden (Lindkvist, 2024), Bangladesh (Asha et al., 2024; King et al., 2021; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018), India (Zehba M. P. et al., 2025), Australia (Ison et al., 2023, 2024), Mexico (Infante

Vargas & Boyer, 2021), Chile (Busco et al., 2022; Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020), and multi-city analyses (Ouali et al., 2020)—consistently reveal that women experience higher levels of fear, engage in extensive “safety work,” and face gender-based violence and harassment, leading to restricted travel patterns and time poverty. The role of bystanders (Tilleman & Chowdhury, 2024) also emerges as a crucial factor in women’s perception of security. These studies collectively establish the urgent need to address the affective, emotional, and safety dimensions of women’s public transport experiences.

However, a significant research gap persists in systematically capturing the unspoken and underreported nature of these challenges at scale and in real-time. This is where the innovative integration of social media analytics (SMA) and Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative solution. SMA has proven its capability to provide realtime, large-scale insights into public perceptions and sentiments across various domains, including urban and transport research (Alharbi & Haq, 2024; Hayat et al., 2019; S et al., 2025; Sufi, 2023; Thelwall, 2017; Yigitcanlar et al., 2020). Specifically, studies by Luo and He (Luo et al., 2023; Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021) have demonstrated its utility in uncovering gendered perceptions of transit services and customer satisfaction.

The advent of LLMs further enhances this capability by enabling more nuanced interpretation of complex, multilingual, and often informal social media data. LLMs excel at understanding semantic meaning, linguistic nuances, and even implicit emotional cues, as demonstrated in mental health analytics (Radwan et al., 2024) and medical chat models (Y. Li et al., 2023). Their ability to process multilingual data and generate contextualized embeddings, potentially even integrating multimodal information (J. Li et al., 2023), makes them ideal for dissecting the intricate narratives of women’s experiences in diverse global metro systems.

The proposed research, by leveraging social media analytics and developing customized LLMs, directly addresses the underreporting issue, offering a scalable and dynamic approach to uncover hidden realities. This methodological innovation, combined with indepth case studies in Asian cities, promises to yield a unique dataset and provide actionable insights that are both broad in scope and deep in contextual understanding. Such a mixed-method approach will allow for the validation of digital findings with lived experiences, linking perceived barriers to actual travel behaviors and access to urban opportunities.

In conclusion, achieving transport equity for women is not merely about providing infrastructure but about ensuring safety, inclusivity, and respect within these systems. This research, by pioneering the application of advanced digital analytics to a critical social issue, stands to make significant theoretical, methodological, empirical, and practical contributions. Future research could build upon this foundation by exploring the development of real-time monitoring and alert systems based on social media insights, investigating the effectiveness of policy interventions through continuous digital feedback loops, and delving deeper into the ethical considerations of data privacy and algorithmic bias in such applications. Ultimately, by systematically uncovering and addressing the gendered barriers to women’s mobility, this work will contribute to creating more equitable, safer, and truly inclusive urban environments for all.

# Barriers to Women’s Mobility in Metro Transit: Uncovering Gendered Experiences Through Social Media Analytics

# Abstract

Urbanization has significantly enhanced transport infrastructure and mobility in cities worldwide, with a growing number of cities either operating or planning metro systems. However, advanced public transport systems like metros do not equally serve all population groups. The literature on transport equity highlights that different social strata benefit unevenly from transit services. Women, in particular, often face unique mobility challenges compared to men. Many of these challenges—such as voyeurism, sexual harassment, and the lack of respect for breastfeeding—are underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma. As a result, they remain largely invisible to passengers, operators, and policymakers, receiving limited attention in mainstream media. This issue is especially pronounced in developing countries, where inadequate surveillance and policing further exacerbate the problem. To address this critical gap, the proposed research will employ a social media analytics approach to capture and analyze unspoken, real-world experiences of women in metro systems globally. Theoretically, this study contributes to the discourse on transport equity by highlighting gendered barriers to mobility. Methodologically, it introduces a novel application of social media analytics in transport research. Empirically, it will create a unique dataset of genderspecific metro experiences across diverse urban contexts. Practically, the findings will provide policymakers and transit operators with actionable insights to enhance safety, inclusivity, and equity in metro systems.

Achieving transport equity requires addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged groups, including women. A safer and more inclusive travel experience can boost women’s mobility, empowering them to access employment, education, and social opportunities both within and beyond their cities. From a societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit not only enhances their well-being but also supports broader goals of social inclusion and gender equality. In advanced economies such as Japan and Hong Kong, urban metros form the backbone of the transport network, handling the majority of daily trips. Yet even in these systems, women often feel unsafe, particularly during nighttime or in sparsely populated areas and on less-frequented lines. Conversely, in cities where metros play a smaller role and public transport usage is lower, reduced passenger volumes do not automatically translate into increased safety. In fact, limited public surveillance can heighten women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts. By systematically tackling these challenges, this research will deepen our understanding of gender and mobility, inform evidence-based interventions, and ultimately help create safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole.

We propose a groundbreaking approach that harnesses social media data to uncover gendered experiences in metro systems across a wide range of global cities. Using keywords like “metro” and related terms in multiple languages, we will collect and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. Guided by a set of predefined service quality dimensions—with a specific focus on safety—we will apply sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to compare and contrast the experiences of women and men. To gain deeper insights, we will conduct case studies in three Asian cities—tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul. In these cities, we will explore how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors. By mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces, we aim to reveal how perceived or experienced barriers limit their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities. This mixedmethod approach combines large-scale digital data with urban transport research to generate actionable knowledge about gendered mobility barriers.

Our solution advances existing approaches to transport equity in three key ways: 1. Leveraging social media analytics: By mining and analyzing vast amounts of social media data, we can uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit—especially in developing countries where official reporting is scarce. By carefully selecting cities across varying income levels (measured by GDP per capita) and gender inequality indices, we will gain a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers. 2. Developing customized language models: We will build our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. 3. Integrating digital analytics with case studies: Through in-depth case studies in three Asian cities, we will complement our large-scale data analysis with focused group discussions. This mixed-method approach will allow us to directly link women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. Together, these innovations will yield richer, more actionable insights than traditional surveys or qualitative studies alone, advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

# Introduction

The relentless march of urbanization has profoundly reshaped cities across the globe, leading to a significant expansion and enhancement of transport infrastructure. Metro systems, in particular, have emerged as the backbone of urban mobility in many metropolises, offering efficient, high-capacity transport solutions that are crucial for economic activity and social connectivity. A growing number of cities, from established global hubs to rapidly developing urban centers, are either operating or actively planning such sophisticated transit networks. However, the promise of enhanced mobility inherent in these advanced public transport systems is not universally realized; their benefits often accrue unevenly across different population groups. The academic discourse on transport equity consistently highlights that various social strata experience and benefit from transit services in fundamentally different ways, leading to disparities in access, experience, and opportunity (Hail & McQuaid, 2021; Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020).

Among these diverse social strata, women frequently encounter a distinct set of mobility challenges that diverge significantly from those faced by men. These challenges are multifaceted, encompassing issues such as voyeurism, various forms of sexual harassment, and a pervasive lack of respect for fundamental needs like breastfeeding in public spaces. A critical aspect of these gendered barriers is their inherent invisibility. Many of these experiences are severely underreported, a phenomenon driven by a complex interplay of social norms, deeply ingrained cultural pressures, and a legitimate fear of stigma or reprisal (Asha et al., 2024; Infante-Vargas & Boyer, 2021; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018). Consequently, these daily realities often remain largely hidden from the very stakeholders who could effect change: fellow passengers, transit operators, and policymakers. This lack of visibility further translates into limited attention in mainstream media, perpetuating a cycle of neglect. The problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where systemic issues such as inadequate surveillance infrastructure and insufficient policing mechanisms exacerbate women’s vulnerability and diminish their sense of safety and security in public transit environments (King et al., 2021; Panjwani, 2018).

Addressing this critical gap in understanding and data requires innovative approaches that can penetrate the veil of underreporting and capture the authentic, real-world experiences of women. Traditional survey methods, while valuable, often struggle to elicit the full spectrum of sensitive and often traumatic experiences due to social desirability bias, recall issues, and the inherent limitations of structured questioning. Qualitative studies, such as in-depth interviews and focus groups, provide rich insights but are typically limited in scale and generalizability (Lindkvist, 2024; Roy et al., 2024; Zehba M. P. et al., 2025). This paper posits that social media analytics offers a powerful, complementary methodology to overcome these limitations. By harnessing the vast, unsolicited, and often raw user-generated content from social media platforms, researchers can uncover the “unspoken” narratives and real-time experiences of women in metro systems across diverse global contexts. This approach promises to shed light on the subtle yet pervasive gendered barriers that impede women’s mobility, thereby enriching the discourse on transport equity.

Theoretically, this study aims to make a significant contribution to the ongoing academic conversation on transport equity by foregrounding the specific and often overlooked gendered barriers to mobility. It moves beyond a generic understanding of access to delve into the qualitative dimensions of experience, particularly focusing on safety and comfort as fundamental components of equitable transit. Methodologically, the proposed research introduces a novel and robust application of social media analytics within the domain of transport research. While social media data has been utilized to gauge general customer satisfaction or public sentiment towards transit services (Luo et al., 2023; Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021), its systematic application to uncover nuanced, gender-specific experiences of vulnerability and harassment, particularly across diverse cultural and economic contexts, remains largely unexplored. Empirically, this endeavor will culminate in the creation of a unique and invaluable dataset comprising gender-specific metro experiences, meticulously collected and analyzed from a wide array of urban

environments worldwide. This dataset will serve as a rich resource for future research, enabling comparative analyses and the identification of universal patterns as well as context-specific nuances. Practically, the anticipated findings will offer actionable insights directly relevant to policymakers and transit operators. By providing an evidence-based understanding of women’s lived experiences, this research can inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions aimed at enhancing safety, fostering inclusivity, and ultimately achieving greater equity in metro systems globally.

The pursuit of transport equity is intrinsically linked to addressing the distinct needs of socially disadvantaged groups, with women being a primary focus. A travel experience that is perceived as safer and genuinely more inclusive has the potential to significantly boost women’s mobility. This enhanced mobility, in turn, is a powerful enabler, empowering women to more readily access critical employment opportunities, pursue educational aspirations, and engage more fully in social and civic life both within and beyond their immediate urban environments. From a broader societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit extends far beyond individual wellbeing; it directly contributes to overarching societal goals of social inclusion and gender equality, fostering more vibrant, productive, and equitable cities. Even in advanced economies renowned for their efficient infrastructure, such as Japan and Hong Kong, where urban metros form the indispensable backbone of the transport network and handle the vast majority of daily trips, women frequently report feeling unsafe. This sentiment is particularly pronounced during nighttime hours, in sparsely populated areas of stations or carriages, and on less-frequented lines (He et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Ouali et al., 2020). Conversely, in cities where metro systems are less developed or play a smaller role in the overall transport landscape, and where public transport usage is generally lower, reduced passenger volumes do not automatically translate into an increased sense of safety. In fact, the inverse can often be true, as limited public surveillance and fewer witnesses can heighten women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts (King et al., 2021; Panjwani, 2018). By systematically investigating and tackling these multifaceted challenges through the proposed research, we aim to deepen the collective understanding of the intricate relationship between gender and mobility, inform the design of evidence-based interventions, and ultimately contribute to the creation of safer, more equitable urban environments that yield benefits for society as a whole.

# The Enduring Challenge of Gendered Mobility Barriers in Public Transit

The concept of urban mobility, while seemingly universal, is profoundly shaped by gender, with women consistently facing distinct and often more severe barriers to safe, efficient, and equitable access to public transportation. This section delves into the multifaceted nature of these gendered mobility challenges, drawing upon a rich body of literature that spans various geographical and socio-economic contexts. The discussion will primarily focus on perceptions of safety and the pervasive issue of harassment, the broader implications of time poverty and unique travel patterns, and a comparative analysis of these challenges in both Global South and developed economies.

# Perceptions of Safety and Harassment: The Invisible Threat

One of the most significant and widely documented barriers to women’s mobility in public transit is the pervasive threat and perception of sexual violence and harassment. This issue is not confined to specific regions but is a global phenomenon, albeit with varying manifestations and intensities. Mazumder and Pokharel Mazumder & Pokharel (2018) highlight the extreme intimidation towards women’s freedom of mobility in urban cities, specifically focusing on Bangladesh, where sexual violence on public transport remains largely invisible due to high rates of under-reporting. This under-reporting is a critical aspect of the problem, as it prevents the issue from being nationally acknowledged and addressed, thereby perpetuating a hostile environment for women’s empowerment. Similarly, Infante-Vargas and Boyer Infante-Vargas & Boyer (2021) detail the pervasiveness of gender-based violence (GBV) that women in Saltillo, Mexico, experience when using public transport, emphasizing that such violence is an everyday reality. Their mixed-method study reveals not only the direct experiences of violence but also the issue of re-victimization and the profound psychological effects that these episodes can have, extending beyond immediate physical harm to impose limits on mobility and incur financial and emotional repercussions.

The qualitative research by Ison et al. Ison et al. (2023) further corroborates these findings, revealing that women and gender-diverse people in Australia are “constantly on alert” due to experiences of sexual violence and harassment on public transport. Their interviews with victim-survivors underscore that beyond significant incidents, there are also “everyday” experiences that cumulatively impact how individuals travel and their overall confidence in public spaces. This constant state of vigilance and the cumulative effect of micro-aggressions and harassment are critical to understanding the psychological burden placed on women. The gender gap in the perception of safety is a consistent finding across numerous studies. Ouali et al. Ouali et al. (2020), using largescale customer satisfaction data for 28 world cities, found a significant gender gap, with women being $10 \%$ more likely than men to feel unsafe in metros (and $6 \%$ for buses). This gap is notably larger for safety perception than for overall satisfaction, suggesting that safety is a distinct and critical dimension of women’s transit experience. Their findings also indicate that more acts of violence, larger carriages, and emptier vehicles decrease women’s feeling of safety, highlighting specific environmental factors that contribute to insecurity. Busco et al. Busco et al. (2022), examining Santiago, Chile, similarly concluded that there is a high perception of insecurity in public transport for both men and women, but it is generally greater among women, older people, and national citizens. They proposed new variables such as fear of harassment, traffic accidents, discrimination, and street protests as crucial for a precise public policy on security issues in public transport. Lindkvist Lindkvist (2024), in the context of Sweden—a country with a strong reputation for gender equality—still found that women fear traveling by public transport and being out in the evenings, indicating that patriarcha norms continue to control women’s everyday transportation choices despite policy recommendations and legislation.

The emotional and psychological impacts of these unsafe conditions are profound. Roy et al. Roy et al. (2024) delve into the affective realm of everyday commutes in Kolkata, demonstrating how the disruptive affects of overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable

conditions produce emotional ordeals, increase travel time and costs, and restrict mobility for women. The sense of despair that emerges often compels women to adjust, accept, and even opt out of public transport. King et al. King et al. (2021), in their study of women in Bangladesh, found that women faced multiple threats to their safety, including gender-based violence, harassment, crime, and traffic injuries, leading to high levels of anxiety and fear. Despite these circumstances, women were often “captive travelers,” forced to make choices based on price and availability rather than safety. This leads to what Ison et al. Ison et al. (2024) term “safety work,” where women and gender-diverse people engage in extensive behavioral changes, strategizing, and planning to mitigate risks. This safety work takes considerable time and effort, often leaving participants feeling stressed, yet they advocate for significant changes to public transport to reduce this burden, including primary prevention of gender-based violence.

The role of bystanders and community support in mitigating these threats is also a crucial area of inquiry. Tilleman and Chowdhury Tilleman & Chowdhury (2024) investigated how the presence of bystanders influences women’s sense of security and self-efficacy when using public transport in Auckland, New Zealand. Their findings suggest that bystander and community support is an important expectation for women, affecting their perception of security. They argue that anti-harassment strategies can be strengthened by building an active bystander community and bolstering support for vulnerable riders, thereby helping to establish harassment as an unacceptable form of passenger behavior. This highlights that solutions are not solely about infrastructure or policing but also about fostering a supportive social environment.

# Beyond Safety: Time Poverty, Travel Patterns, and Accessibility

While safety and harassment are paramount concerns, gendered mobility barriers extend beyond these immediate threats to encompass broader issues of time, travel patterns, and overall accessibility to urban opportunities. Women’s daily lives are often characterized by complex mobility patterns, frequently involving multiple stops for caregiving, household chores, and work, known as “trip chaining.” This complexity is exacerbated by the phenomenon of “time poverty,” which disproportionately affects urban women due to societal expectations of balancing their work and gender roles. Zehba M. P. et al. Zehba M. P. et al. (2025) explore this in Kochi, India, highlighting how entrenched gender roles burden women with unpaid domestic and caregiving responsibilities, leading to severe time poverty among low-income working women. Their study emphasizes how time poverty is further exacerbated by travel constraints and limited access to transport services, underscoring the necessity for institutional reforms to improve the quality of life for urban women workers.

These distinct travel patterns and responsibilities also influence women’s choices and experiences with public transport. Liu et al. Liu et al. (2022), using smart card data from Shizuoka, Japan, found that female users exhibit higher intrapersonal variability in weekly public transport usage than their male counterparts. This suggests that women’s travel needs are often less predictable and more diverse, requiring flexible and reliable transport options. Chowdhury S. Chowdhury (2019) investigated the role of gender in the ridership of public transport routes involving transfers, finding that women drivers are $30 \%$ more likely than men to make a transfer, given time savings. However, “perceived safety

at stations” was only significant for female riders, and the presence of security guards significantly increased women’s likelihood to use routes with transfers. This indicates that while women are willing to make more complex journeys for efficiency, their decisions are heavily mediated by safety concerns at transfer points. Sagaris and TiznadoAitken Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken (2020), examining Santiago, Chile, underline the importance of considering non-work trip purposes and achieving better land-use combinations to accommodate care-oriented trips, which are predominantly undertaken by women. They also note that women account for a disproportionately high number of walking trips, which, while appearing “sustainable,” often reflects significant inequalities in access to motorized transport. This suggests that environmental and economic sustainability gains can come at a high social cost if gender equity is not explicitly addressed.

The broader concepts of “fairness” and “mobility justice” are crucial for framing these discussions. Hail and McQuaid Hail & McQuaid (2021) discuss the concept of fairness in transport specifically regarding women, noting that women generally have varying and complex mobility patterns and suffer disproportionate fairness issues. They explore different concepts of fairness, including equality of opportunity, equity, and justice (procedural, social, and distributional), and highlight factors such as safety, cost, physical design, and childcare responsibilities as key fairness issues. Shakibaei and VorobjovasPinta Shakibaei & Vorobjovas-Pinta (2022) extend this discourse to transgender and gender-diverse people, investigating their mobilities in Istanbul, Turkey. Their qualitative interviews reveal that these individuals face significant issues such as violence, discrimination, and harassment when using public transport, impacting their access to leisure. They advocate for driver training, education, and proactive educational messaging around gender minorities in public spaces to improve comfort and safety. This highlights that mobility justice must encompass the experiences of all gender minorities, not just cisgender women.

# Contextualizing Gendered Mobility: Global South and Developed Economies

The challenges to women’s mobility, while universal in their underlying gendered nature, manifest differently and with varying degrees of severity across diverse socio-economic and cultural contexts. A comparative analysis between the Global South and developed economies reveals both commonalities and distinct nuances.

In the Global South, the issues are often exacerbated by systemic deficiencies, including inadequate infrastructure, limited resources for public safety, and deeply entrenched patriarchal norms. Studies from this region consistently highlight the severe nature of the challenges. For instance, Asha et al. Asha et al. (2024) call attention to the challenges associated with Global South women’s safety in public transportation, using Bangladeshi women’s experiences of sexual harassment and assault to inform autonomous vehicle design. Their focus group findings revealed distressing experiences of abuse and the safety measures women undertake, emphasizing the need for design justice. Mazumder and Pokharel Mazumder & Pokharel (2018), as previously mentioned, underscore the invisibility and under-reporting of sexual violence in Bangladesh, which creates a hostile environment for women’s empowerment. King et al. King et al. (2021) further elaborate on the multiple threats faced by women in Bangladesh, including gender-based violence, harassment, and crime, leading to high anxiety and restricted travel. Panjwani Panjwani (2018) highlights the gender discriminatory nature of the transportation sector in developing countries like Pakistan, affecting the mobility of women and third genders due to inequities in provision and accessibility. This study emphasizes how such constraints not only affect mobility but also shape women’s occupation of public spheres, advocating for gender mainstreaming in transport policy. Roy et al. Roy et al. (2024)’s work in Kolkata, India, vividly portrays how overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable conditions trigger emotional ordeals and restrict women’s mobility, compelling them to adjust or opt out. Shakthi Shakthi (2024), reviewing a book on masculinities in Kolkata, further illustrates how men’s relational experiences of city life shape gendered configurations of urban space, reinforcing the city as a heteronormative space and upholding the patriarchal gender order, which consequently makes the city challenging for women. Zehba M. P. et al. Zehba M. P. et al. (2025)’s study in Kochi, India, on time poverty, also points to the unique burdens faced by women in developing nations due to societal expectations and travel constraints.

Conversely, in advanced economies, while the overt forms of violence might be less prevalent or better managed by law enforcement, the underlying gendered perceptions of safety and the need for “safety work” persist. Lindkvist Lindkvist (2024)‘s study in Sweden, despite the country’s reputation for gender equality, reveals that women still fear public transport, especially at night, indicating that patriarchal norms continue to influence women’s use of public space. In Japan, Liu et al. Liu et al. (2022) show distinct gender differences in travel pattern variability, with female users exhibiting higher intrapersonal variability, suggesting that even in highly efficient systems, women’s mobility needs are more complex. Ison et al. Ison et al. (2023) and Ison et al. (2024)’s research in Australia demonstrates that women and gender-diverse people engage in extensive “safety work” on public transport, constantly being on alert due to experiences of sexual violence and harassment, even in a developed context. Tilleman and Chowdhury Tilleman & Chowdhury (2024)’s study in Auckland, New Zealand, reinforces the importance of bystander support for women’s perception of security, highlighting that even in a relatively safe environment, the social dynamics of public spaces remain critical. Chowdhury S. Chowdhury (2019)’s work in New Zealand also underscores that while women may be willing to use routes with transfers, their decisions are significantly influenced by perceived safety at stations, a factor less critical for men. Ouali et al. Ouali et al. (2020)’s cross-city analysis, including many developed cities, consistently finds a significant gender gap in safety perception in metros and buses. He et al. He et al. (2023), in their study of Hong Kong, a highly transit-oriented city, found that an efficient public transport system improved passengers’ travel satisfaction, with reduced crowdedness enhancing this effect, but did not specifically delve into detailed gendered safety perceptions beyond general satisfaction.

The common thread across both contexts is the enduring influence of patriarchal norms and societal expectations that shape women’s experiences of public space and mobility. However, the Global South often grapples with the additional burden of inadequate infrastructure, weaker institutional frameworks, and more pronounced socio-economic inequalities that amplify these challenges. The underreporting of incidents, a universal issue, is particularly acute in developing countries where formal reporting mechanisms may be less accessible or trusted, and social stigma is more potent. This comparative perspective underscores the need for context-sensitive solutions while also recognizing the fundamental gendered nature of mobility barriers that transcend geographical boundaries.

# Social Media Analytics as a Lens for Urban Mobility Research

The advent of the digital age and the proliferation of social media platforms have ushered in an unprecedented era of data availability, offering novel avenues for understanding complex social phenomena. In the realm of urban mobility research, social media analytics (SMA) has emerged as a powerful methodological tool, capable of capturing public sentiment, identifying emerging trends, and providing real-time insights that traditional research methods often miss. This section explores the fundamentals and diverse applications of SMA, particularly within the context of transport research, while also acknowledging its inherent methodological advantages and limitations.

# Fundamentals and Applications of Social Media Analytics

Social media analytics refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from social media platforms to extract valuable insights. Its potential for eliciting public opinion about predefined topics is widespread across social sciences, government, and business, partly replacing traditional survey-based methods (Thelwall, 2017). The sheer volume and velocity of user-generated content (UGC) on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Weibo provide an enormous public repository of textual, visual, and multimodal data from which valuable information can be extracted (R. H. Chowdhury, 2024; Hu et al., 2019; S et al., 2025).

The applications of SMA are remarkably diverse. In business intelligence, firms can extract valuable information to measure brand personality by integrating different sources of social media data generated by consumers, employees, and firms. Hu et al. Hu et al. (2019) developed a text analytics framework for this purpose, demonstrating high prediction accuracy and identifying links between consumer identity, employee perceptions, and brand personality. In public health, SMA has been utilized to identify individuals affected by stress-related disorders, leveraging LLM embeddings and machine learning models to classify social media posts (Radwan et al., 2024). During crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, SMA has proven invaluable for authorities to capture public perceptions and inform policy decisions. Yigitcanlar et al. Yigitcanlar et al. (2020) conducted a systematic geo-Twitter analysis in Australia, demonstrating that SMA is an efficient approach to understand community attitudes and guide interventions during a pandemic, especially when direct public consultations are challenging. Similarly, Alharbi and Haq Alharbi & Haq (2024) investigated the effectiveness of transformer models like DistilBERT in classifying disaster-related tweets, highlighting the potential of advanced social media analytics to enhance disaster response and public safety. Beyond these, SMA has also been applied to understand consumer acceptance of product-service systems, as demonstrated by Pourranjbar et al. Pourranjbar et al. (2024), who analyzed tweets related to Zipcar to identify barriers to adoption, using topic modeling and sentiment analysis. These diverse applications underscore the versatility and growing importance of SMA across various domains.

The advantages of SMA in research are manifold. Firstly, it offers access to real-time data, providing immediate insights into public sentiment and emerging issues, which is a significant improvement over the often-lagging nature of traditional surveys (Luo et al., 2023; Yigitcanlar et al., 2020). Secondly, the vast volume of data available on social media platforms allows for large-scale analysis, enabling researchers to identify patterns and trends that might be missed in smaller, more localized studies (Luo & He, 2021; Thelwall, 2017). Thirdly, social media content often represents unsolicited opinions, providing a more authentic and less filtered perspective compared to responses in structured surveys, which can be influenced by social desirability bias (Thelwall, 2017). This ability to capture raw, unfiltered expressions is particularly valuable for understanding sensitive topics. Finally, SMA can capture nuances and contextual information, including spatial and temporal dynamics, which enrich the understanding of complex phenomena like urban mobility experiences (Luo et al., 2023; Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021).

# Methodological Approaches in Social Media Analytics for Transport

Within the specific context of transport research, social media analytics employs a range of sophisticated techniques to extract meaningful insights from user-generated content. The primary methodological approaches include sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and topic modeling, often integrated with spatial and temporal analyses.

Sentiment analysis, a core component of SMA, involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text—whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is pivotal for assessing customer satisfaction and perceptions of transit services. Chowdhury R. H. Chowdhury (2024) provides a comprehensive review of sentiment analysis and social media analytics in brand management, highlighting its critical role in understanding consumer perceptions and optimizing brand engagement. The principles discussed are directly transferable to public transport, where understanding passenger sentiment towards service quality, safety, and comfort is paramount. S. et al. S et al. (2025) advocate for an architecture that unifies NLP for text-based content and deep learning for visual data into emotion categorization, recognizing that traditional techniques often fail to merge multimodal inputs into actionable insights. This advanced approach, combining models like EfficientNet for visual data and GPT-2 for text, demonstrates the evolving sophistication of sentiment analysis. Luo et al. Luo et al. (2023) and Luo & He (2021) have successfully applied sentiment analysis as a real-time measurement of customers’ satisfaction towards transit services in China, covering dimensions like safety, crowdedness, reliability, personnel behavior, and comfort. Their work reveals how customer satisfaction varies among different market segments characterized by social, temporal, and spatial heterogeneity, and importantly, highlights gendered attitudes.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are fundamental to extracting structured information from unstructured text data. This includes tasks such as tokenization, part-ofspeech tagging, named entity recognition, and text classification. Hayat et al. Hayat et al. (2019) discuss the increasing attention on deep learning (DL) for social media analytics, particularly for its significant processing power in text processing. They emphasize how

DL architectures can address SMA-oriented problems, especially given the scalability, heterogeneity, and multimodality challenges of social media data. Alharbi and Haq Alharbi & Haq (2024), for instance, utilized DistilBERT, a transformer model, for classifying disaster-related tweets, showcasing the power of advanced NLP models in extracting critical information from social media. Maghsoudi et al. Maghsoudi et al. (2024) also employed advanced text analytics on Twitter data to systematically explore public concerns regarding AI, identifying distinct clusters of concerns through large-scale data collection. These applications demonstrate NLP’s capability to process vast amounts of text, identify key themes, and classify content based on specific criteria.

Topic modeling, another crucial technique, helps in identifying abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. Pourranjbar et al. Pourranjbar et al. (2024) utilized topic modeling alongside sentiment analysis to identify factors influencing the acceptance of product-service systems from social media data. In transport research, this can help uncover the specific issues that passengers are discussing, such as maintenance problems, staff behavior, or safety concerns, without predefined categories.

The integration of semantic, spatial, and temporal information from social media data is particularly powerful for urban mobility research. Luo et al. Luo & He (2020) proposed a framework for integrating quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate perceptions of transport services by mining Sina Weibo data related to the Shenzhen metro system. Their study categorized information by semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions, identifying service attributes specific to the Chinese context, clear temporal variations among different attributes (e.g., crowdedness peaks at certain hours), and spatial variations around central business districts and transport hubs for issues like crowdedness and reliability. Crucially, they noted that microblogs reporting on perceptions of safety and personnel behavior presented a different spatial pattern, indicating the nuanced insights achievable through such integrated analyses. Luo and He Luo & He (2021) further investigated gendered attitudes toward transit services in Shenzhen, utilizing text mining and visualization techniques to examine gender differences across focused themes. They found a distinct gender gap in quantity of posts and concerns, with women more focused on comfort, crowdedness, and safety (especially at night), while men were more interested in e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. This demonstrates the capacity of SMA to reveal gender-specific perceptions and priorities.

Despite its numerous advantages, social media analytics also presents several limitations. Thelwall Thelwall (2017) points out that SMA’s potential and limitations are poorly understood, deriving from its fundamentally exploratory, multi-method nature. Key challenges include data accuracy, as social media content can be noisy, informal, and contain sarcasm or irony that is difficult for algorithms to interpret accurately (R. H. Chowdhury, 2024). Privacy issues are also a significant concern, as the use of public data raises ethical questions about consent and anonymity. The dynamic and ever-evolving nature of social media platforms, with new trends, slang, and features constantly emerging, requires continuous adaptation of analytical tools and models. Furthermore, representativeness can be an issue; social media users may not be a demographic crosssection of the entire population, potentially leading to biases in the insights generated. For instance, Luo and He Luo & He (2021) noted a distinct gender gap in the quantity of microblogs, with nearly $74 \%$ posted by women, which, while useful for understanding women’s perspectives, might not fully represent men’s experiences if their online engagement patterns differ. These limitations necessitate careful methodological design and interpretation of findings, often advocating for mixed-method approaches to validate and enrich social media-derived insights.

# The Transformative Role of Large Language Models in Social Media Analytics

The landscape of natural language processing (NLP) has been dramatically reshaped by the emergence and rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). These sophisticated AI models, trained on colossal datasets of text and code, possess an unprecedented ability to understand, generate, and process human language with remarkable fluency and nuance. Their integration into social media analytics represents a transformative leap, promising to overcome many of the traditional limitations associated with analyzing vast, informal, and often multilingual user-generated content. This section will explore the evolution and capabilities of LLMs, and subsequently detail how they enhance the precision and depth of social media analysis, particularly for uncovering complex and sensitive issues like gendered mobility barriers.

# Evolution and Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models represent a paradigm shift from earlier NLP techniques, which often relied on rule-based systems, statistical methods, or shallower neural networks. The evolution of LLMs, particularly models based on the transformer architecture, has led to significant breakthroughs in various NLP tasks. These models are characterized by their vast number of parameters, enabling them to learn intricate patterns and relationships within language that were previously unattainable. Radwan et al. Radwan et al. (2024) highlight the capabilities of LLMs, specifically focusing on OpenAI’s generative pretrained transformer (GPT-3) embeddings, in transforming textual data into vector representations that capture semantic meaning and linguistic nuances. This ability to convert text into rich, context-aware numerical representations is fundamental to their power.

A key capability of LLMs is their capacity for “pre-training” on massive, diverse text corpora, followed by “fine-tuning” for specific downstream tasks. This two-stage process allows LLMs to acquire a broad understanding of language during pre-training and then adapt this knowledge to specialized domains or tasks with relatively smaller, task-specific datasets. Li et al. Y. Li et al. (2023) exemplify this by creating “ChatDoctor,” a medical chat model fine-tuned on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA) using a large dataset of patient-doctor dialogues. Their research demonstrates that fine-tuning with real-world interactions significantly improves the model’s ability to understand patient needs and provide informed advice, underscoring the adaptability and domain-specific accuracy achievable with LLMs. This capacity for fine-tuning is particularly relevant for social media analytics, where the language is often informal, context-dependent, and replete with slang or domain-specific jargon.

Furthermore, LLMs excel at understanding complex textual data, including subtle emotional cues, sarcasm, and implicit meanings that traditional rule-based or lexiconbased sentiment analysis methods often struggle with. Their attention mechanisms allow them to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information more effectively than previous models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) alone. While CNNs are adept at extracting local positional information and RNNs at handling sequential data, LLMs combine these strengths and surpass them by processing entire sequences in parallel and understanding global context more comprehensively (Hayat et al., 2019). This advanced understanding of linguistic nuances is crucial for analyzing social media content, which is often characterized by brevity, informality, and a high degree of emotional expression.

# LLMs for Enhanced Social Media Analysis

The integration of Large Language Models into social media analytics significantly elevates the precision and depth of insights that can be extracted from user-generated content. This enhancement is particularly evident in areas such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and the nuanced interpretation of multilingual and informal text.

Firstly, LLMs dramatically improve the accuracy and granularity of sentiment analysis. Traditional sentiment analysis often relies on lexicons or simpler machine learning models that can misinterpret context, sarcasm, or subtle emotional states. LLMs, with their deep understanding of semantic meaning and linguistic nuances, can discern these complexities more effectively. Radwan et al. Radwan et al. (2024), for instance, demonstrate how GPT-3 embeddings, combined with machine learning algorithms, can classify social media posts indicative of stress disorders with high accuracy, far surpassing what simpler models might achieve. This ability to capture subtle emotional signals is invaluable for understanding the lived experiences of women in public transit, where fear, discomfort, or anxiety might be expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. S. et al. S et al. (2025) further emphasize this by proposing an architecture that unifies NLP (using GPT-2 optimized with LoRA) for text-based content and deep learning for visual data into emotion categorization, recognizing that multimodal data requires advanced models to extract meaningful emotional context. This indicates that LLMs can process not just explicit statements but also the underlying emotional valence, which is crucial fo sensitive topics.

Secondly, LLMs are highly effective in handling the inherent challenges of social media data, such as its multilingual nature, informality, and noise. Social media content is often written in colloquial language, contains abbreviations, emojis, and code-switching between languages. Traditional NLP models require extensive pre-processing and language-specific resources. LLMs, particularly those trained on vast multilingual corpora, are inherently better equipped to process and understand diverse linguistic expressions across different cultural contexts. Hayat et al. Hayat et al. (2019) discuss how deep learning, including LLMs, offers an appropriate solution for analyzing the exponential development and widespread availability of digital social media data, which is often intractable for traditional tools due to its scalability, heterogeneity, and multimodality. Their work highlights the potential of DL to clean and process such complex data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of experiences. This capability is particularly vital for a global study aiming to capture

women’s experiences in metros across various cities and languages, as outlined in the proposed research abstract.

Thirdly, LLMs can enhance topic modeling and the identification of public concerns by providing more coherent and semantically rich clusters of themes. Maghsoudi et al. Maghsoudi et al. (2024), for example, employed large-scale social media data from Twitter and advanced text analytics to identify seven distinct clusters of public concerns regarding AI. LLMs can help in this process by better understanding the underlying themes and relationships between different posts, even if they use varied vocabulary. This allows researchers to move beyond simple keyword matching to a deeper understanding of the issues being discussed. For transport research, this means LLMs can help uncover specific types of harassment, design flaws, or operational issues that contribute to women’s insecurity, even if these are expressed in diverse and indirect ways.

Finally, LLMs facilitate the extraction of deeper insights by enabling more sophisticated forms of text generation and summarization, which can help in synthesizing vast amounts of social media data into actionable intelligence. While not explicitly detailed in the provided literature for social media analytics, the general capabilities of LLMs in summarization and information retrieval (Y. Li et al., 2023) suggest their potential to distill key findings from large datasets of user experiences. However, it is also important to acknowledge that while LLMs offer immense potential, challenges remain. These include the computational resources required for training and deployment, the potential for bias amplification if the training data is biased, and the need for careful validation of their interpretations, especially for sensitive topics. Despite these challenges, the transformative role of LLMs in social media analytics is undeniable, offering unprecedented opportunities to uncover complex social realities with greater accuracy and depth.

# Bridging the Gap: Uncovering Gendered Mobility Experiences with Digital Analytics

The preceding sections have established the pervasive nature of gendered mobility barriers in public transit and the immense potential of social media analytics, particularly when augmented by Large Language Models (LLMs), to capture public sentiment and experiences. This section aims to bridge these two domains, critically examining how digital analytics has been applied to gendered transport research thus far, identifying existing gaps, and articulating the synergistic potential of a novel approach that combines social media analytics, customized LLMs, and mixed-method case studies to uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in metro systems.

# Current Applications and Gaps in Gendered Transport Research using Digital Data

While the application of social media analytics in transport research is gaining traction, its specific utility in comprehensively uncovering gendered experiences, particularly the underreported issues of harassment and fear, remains an evolving field. Some pioneering studies have, however, demonstrated the promise of this approach. Luo et al. Luo et al. (2023) and Luo & He (2021) have made significant contributions by utilizing social media data to investigate gender differences in perceptions toward transit services in

China. Luo et al. Luo et al. (2023), in their study on customer satisfaction in transit services, used crowdsourced data to capture heterogeneity across individuals, space, and time. Their application of sentiment analysis and a beta regression model revealed that age, gender, travel mode, time, and space significantly contribute to customer satisfaction, and critically, their study revealed the “highly polarized nature of online sentiment, explaining gendered attitudes.” This finding is crucial as it indicates that social media can indeed reflect distinct gendered perspectives on public transport.

Building on this, Luo and He Luo & He (2021) specifically aimed to investigate gendered attitudes toward transit services in Shenzhen, China, using 44,257 Weibo microblogs. Their findings revealed a distinct gender gap in terms of quantity of posts, with nearly $74 \%$ posted by women. More importantly, they found that women tended to be more concerned about the comfort of the transit environment, including temperature, crowdedness, and safety, “especially at night.” In contrast, men were more interested in e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. This study clearly demonstrates that social media mining can provide valuable insights into gender-specific concerns and priorities in public transport, offering a methodological framework for investigating subjective travel experiences. Similarly, Luo et al. Luo & He (2020), in their broader study on urban analytics for metro services in Shenzhen, identified spatial and temporal dynamics of perceptions, noting that microblogs reporting on perceptions of safety and personnel behavior presented a different spatial pattern compared to other service attributes. While not explicitly gender-focused, this work lays the groundwork for understanding how specific concerns, including safety, manifest spatially and temporally in digital discourse.

Despite these valuable contributions, several critical gaps persist in the current application of digital data to gendered transport research. Firstly, while studies like those by Luo and He Luo & He (2021) identify “safety” as a gendered concern, they often rely on general sentiment analysis or keyword matching, which may not fully capture the nuance and severity of underreported experiences such as sexual harassment, voyeurism, or subtle forms of intimidation. The abstract of the proposed research explicitly states that many challenges like voyeurism and sexual harassment are “underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma,” making them “largely invisible.” Traditional sentiment analysis, even when applied to social media, might struggle to differentiate between general discomfort and specific experiences of gender-based violence, especially when expressed indirectly or euphemistically. The methods employed in the cited studies, while effective for broad sentiment and topic identification, may not be sufficiently granular to uncover these deeply sensitive and often unspoken realities.

Secondly, the existing literature, while demonstrating the potential of social media, has not fully leveraged the advanced capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to process multilingual, highly informal, and culturally nuanced social media data on a global scale. The studies by Luo et al. Luo et al. (2023); Luo & He (2021); Luo & He (2020) primarily focus on a single city (Shenzhen) and a single language (Chinese microblogs), limiting the generalizability of findings across diverse urban and cultural contexts. The need for customized language models that can clean and process multilingual data for more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of

gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts is a significant unmet need, as highlighted in the proposed research abstract. Without such advanced models, the ability to compare and contrast experiences across cities like Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul, where linguistic and cultural expressions of discomfort or harassment can vary significantly, remains limited.

Finally, while digital data offers breadth, it often lacks the depth of qualitative insights that can link perceived barriers to actual travel behaviors and access to urban opportunities. The “mixed-method approach” and “integrating digital analytics with case studies” proposed in the abstract address this gap, aiming to complement large-scale data analysis with focused group discussions to directly link women’s metro experiences to their mobility patterns and access to opportunities. This integration is crucial for generating “actionable knowledge” that goes beyond identifying problems to understanding their real-world consequences.

# The Synergistic Potential of Social Media Analytics and LLMs for Gendered Mobility

The proposed research, as outlined in its abstract, offers a groundbreaking approach that synergistically combines social media analytics with advanced Large Language Models and mixed-method case studies to address the identified gaps and uncover gendered experiences in metro systems globally. This integrated solution advances existing approaches to transport equity in several key ways, promising richer, more actionable insights than traditional methods or digital analytics alone.

Firstly, the strategic leveraging of social media analytics is central to uncovering the “often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit—especially in developing countries where official reporting is scarce.” By mining and analyzing vast amounts of social media data, the research can tap into a reservoir of unsolicited, realtime narratives that bypass the limitations of formal reporting mechanisms and traditional surveys. As discussed by Thelwall Thelwall (2017), social media data mining offers a powerful way to elicit public opinion, and its application here is specifically tailored to sensitive, underreported issues. The ability to select cities across varying income levels (measured by GDP per capita) and gender inequality indices, as proposed, will provide a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers. This comparative lens, facilitated by large-scale data, will allow for the identification of both universal patterns of harassment and context-specific manifestations influenced by local cultural norms and infrastructure. For instance, while Mazumder and Pokharel Mazumder & Pokharel (2018) highlight underreporting in Bangladesh, and Infante-Vargas and Boyer Infante-Vargas & Boyer (2021) detail everyday violence in Mexico, social media can provide a parallel, less filtered stream of information that complements and potentially validates these qualitative findings on a much larger scale.

Secondly, the development of customized Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical innovation for this research. While existing studies have used NLP and sentiment analysis (Luo et al., 2023; Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021), the proposed approach goes further by building “our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data.” This is crucial for several reasons. Social media content is inherently noisy, informal, and often multilingual, especially when drawing data from diverse global cities. Generic LLMs, while powerful, may not be optimally tuned for the specific nuances of informal, emotionally charged, or culturally specific expressions of fear, discomfort, or harassment. Customized LLMs, fine-tuned on relevant domain-specific data, can achieve more accurate sentiment analysis and a more nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. As Li et al. Y. Li et al. (2023) demonstrated with “ChatDoctor,” fine-tuning LLMs for specific domains significantly enhances their ability to understand nuanced needs and provide informed insights. This bespoke approach will allow the research to capture subtle linguistic cues, slang, and indirect expressions of vulnerability that might be missed by off-the-shelf models, thereby uncovering the “unspoken” aspects of women’s experiences with greater fidelity. The ability of LLMs to capture semantic meaning and linguistic nuances, as highlighted by Radwan et al. Radwan et al. (2024), will be instrumental in processing the complex textual data from social media.

Thirdly, the integration of digital analytics with in-depth case studies represents a robust mixed-method approach that addresses the limitations of relying solely on either quantitative or qualitative data. Through focused group discussions in three Asian cities (tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul), the research will complement the large-scale digital data analysis. This qualitative component will allow for a deeper exploration of “how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors.” This direct linkage between perceived or experienced barriers and their impact on women’s travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities is vital for generating actionable knowledge. While social media analytics can identify what is being discussed and where, qualitative studies can illuminate why and how these issues impact daily lives. For example, the “safety work” identified by Ison et al. Ison et al. (2024) or the emotional ordeals described by Roy et al. Roy et al. (2024) can be validated and contextualized through focus group discussions, providing a human-centric understanding that complements the digital insights. This mixed-methodology ensures that the research not only identifies widespread patterns but also understands the underlying mechanisms and lived experiences, thereby advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

In essence, this synergistic approach moves beyond merely identifying gender gaps in satisfaction, as seen in some earlier social media studies, to deeply investigate the specific forms of harassment and fear that constrain women’s mobility. By combining the breadth and real-time nature of social media data, the interpretive power of customized LLMs, and the depth of qualitative case studies, the proposed research is uniquely positioned to uncover the invisible barriers to women’s mobility in metro transit, providing an unprecedented understanding that can inform targeted, evidence-based interventions for creating safer, more inclusive, and equitable urban environments.

# Conclusion

The comprehensive review of existing literature unequivocally demonstrates that women worldwide face significant and often unique barriers to mobility in public transit, particularly within metro systems. These challenges extend beyond mere access to encompass profound issues of safety, security, and the psychological burden of

navigating public spaces. Studies consistently highlight the pervasive nature of sexual harassment, voyeurism, and a general lack of respect, which collectively contribute to a significant gender gap in the perception of safety (Busco et al., 2022; Lindkvist, 2024; Ouali et al., 2020). This fear is not merely abstract; it translates into tangible behavioral adaptations, often termed “safety work,” where women modify their travel patterns, avoid certain routes or times, and remain constantly vigilant, incurring emotional and temporal costs (Ison et al., 2024; King et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2024). Furthermore, the literature underscores that these experiences are severely underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma, rendering them largely invisible to policymakers and transit operators, especially in developing countries where institutional support and surveillance are often inadequate (Asha et al., 2024; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018; Panjwani, 2018). Beyond safety, women disproportionately experience time poverty due to caregiving responsibilities, which, combined with complex trip-chaining patterns, further constrains their mobility and access to vital urban opportunities (Liu et al., 2022; Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020; Zehba M. P. et al., 2025). The call for mobility justice and gender equity in transport, encompassing the experiences of all gender-diverse individuals, resonates across diverse geographical and socio-economic contexts (Hail & McQuaid, 2021; Shakibaei & Vorobjovas-Pinta, 2022).

Despite the wealth of qualitative research detailing these lived experiences, and the growing application of social media analytics in transport, a critical research gap persists. While social media has been successfully leveraged to gauge general customer satisfaction and identify broad gendered perceptions of transit services (Luo et al., 2023; Luo & He, 2020; Luo & He, 2021), it has not yet been systematically applied to uncover the nuanced, underreported, and often unspoken realities of gender-based harassment and fear in metro systems on a global scale. Existing digital analytics often lack the granularity and cross-cultural interpretive capacity to fully capture the subtle expressions of vulnerability, discomfort, and specific forms of harassment that are crucial for understanding the full spectrum of women’s mobility barriers. The limitations of traditional sentiment analysis in handling informal, multilingual, and emotionally complex social media data further exacerbate this gap.

The proposed research directly addresses this critical void through an innovative and multi-pronged methodological approach. By leveraging social media analytics on a vast scale, it aims to capture the real-world, unsolicited experiences of women across diverse urban contexts, thereby circumventing the limitations of formal reporting and traditional surveys. The development of customized Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal advancement, enabling the cleaning and processing of multilingual data with enhanced accuracy and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences, which is essential for a truly global comparative analysis. This bespoke LLM approach will allow for the detection of subtle linguistic cues and indirect expressions of fear or harassment that might be missed by generic NLP tools. Furthermore, the integration of large-scale digital analytics with in-depth qualitative case studies in selected Asian cities will provide a crucial mixed-method framework. This combination will not only identify widespread patterns of concern but also delve into the “why” and “how,” directly linking perceived or experienced barriers to women’s actual travel behaviors, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. This holistic approach promises to generate richer, more actionable insights than either method could achieve in isolation.

Looking ahead, several future directions for research emerge from this review. Firstly, there is a need for continuous refinement of LLM applications for specific cultural and linguistic nuances in gendered mobility research. This includes developing models that are highly sensitive to local slang, euphemisms, and indirect expressions of harassment, which vary significantly across different societies. Further research could explore the ethical implications of using social media data for such sensitive topics, ensuring privacy and avoiding potential biases inherent in AI models. Secondly, integrating more diverse data sources, beyond textual social media content, such as image and video analysis (as suggested by S et al. (2025) for multimodal emotion categorization), could provide an even richer understanding of women’s experiences, including non-verbal cues of discomfort or unsafe environments. Thirdly, future research should focus on translating these digital insights into concrete, evidence-based policy interventions. This involves developing frameworks for transit operators and urban planners to systematically monitor social media for gendered safety concerns and to implement targeted improvements in infrastructure, surveillance, and public awareness campaigns. Finally, longitudinal studies using social media analytics could track the effectiveness of such interventions over time, providing continuous feedback loops for creating truly equitable and inclusive metro systems. By systematically tackling these challenges, this research and its future extensions will deepen our understanding of gender and mobility, inform evidence-based interventions, and ultimately help create safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole, empowering women to fully participate in urban life.

# Barriers to Women’s Mobility in Metro Transit: Uncovering Gendered Experiences Through Social Media Analytics

# Abstract

Urbanization has significantly enhanced transport infrastructure and mobility in cities worldwide, with a growing number of cities either operating or planning metro systems. However, advanced public transport systems like metros do not equally serve all population groups. The literature on transport equity highlights that different social strata benefit unevenly from transit services. Women, in particular, often face unique mobility challenges compared to men. Many of these challenges—such as voyeurism, sexual harassment, and the lack of respect for breastfeeding—are underreported due to social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma. As a result, they remain largely invisible to passengers, operators, and policymakers, receiving limited attention in mainstream media. This issue is especially pronounced in developing countries, where inadequate surveillance and policing further exacerbate the problem. To address this critical gap, the proposed research will employ a social media analytics approach to capture and analyze unspoken, real-world experiences of women in metro systems globally. Theoretically, this study contributes to the discourse on transport equity by highlighting gendered

barriers to mobility. Methodologically, it introduces a novel application of social media analytics in transport research. Empirically, it will create a unique dataset of genderspecific metro experiences across diverse urban contexts. Practically, the findings will provide policymakers and transit operators with actionable insights to enhance safety, inclusivity, and equity in metro systems.

Achieving transport equity requires addressing the needs of socially disadvantaged groups, including women. A safer and more inclusive travel experience can boost women’s mobility, empowering them to access employment, education, and social opportunities both within and beyond their cities. From a societal perspective, improving women’s experiences in public transit not only enhances their well-being but also supports broader goals of social inclusion and gender equality. In advanced economies such as Japan and Hong Kong, urban metros form the backbone of the transport network, handling the majority of daily trips. Yet even in these systems, women often feel unsafe, particularly during nighttime or in sparsely populated areas and on less-frequented lines. Conversely, in cities where metros play a smaller role and public transport usage is lower, reduced passenger volumes do not automatically translate into increased safety. In fact, limited public surveillance can heighten women’s vulnerability to harassment and other harmful acts. By systematically tackling these challenges, this research will deepen our understanding of gender and mobility, inform evidence-based interventions, and ultimately help create safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole.

We propose a groundbreaking approach that harnesses social media data to uncover gendered experiences in metro systems across a wide range of global cities. Using keywords like “metro” and related terms in multiple languages, we will collect and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms. Guided by a set of predefined service quality dimensions—with a specific focus on safety—we will apply sentiment analysis and natural language processing techniques to compare and contrast the experiences of women and men. To gain deeper insights, we will conduct case studies in three Asian cities—tentatively Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul. In these cities, we will explore how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors. By mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces, we aim to reveal how perceived or experienced barriers limit their access to employment, education, and other urban opportunities. This mixedmethod approach combines large-scale digital data with urban transport research to generate actionable knowledge about gendered mobility barriers.

Our solution advances existing approaches to transport equity in three key ways: 1. Leveraging social media analytics: By mining and analyzing vast amounts of social media data, we can uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit—especially in developing countries where official reporting is scarce. By carefully selecting cities across varying income levels (measured by GDP per capita) and gender inequality indices, we will gain a truly global perspective on gendered mobility barriers. 2. Developing customized language models: We will build our own large language models (LLMs) to clean and process multilingual data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis and nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across diverse cultural contexts. 3. Integrating digital analytics with case studies: Through in-depth case studies in three Asian cities, we will complement our large-scale data analysis with focused group discussions. This mixed-method approach will allow us to directly link women’s metro experiences to their travel behavior, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities. Together, these innovations will yield richer, more actionable insights than traditional surveys or qualitative studies alone, advancing both theory and practice in gendered transport equity research.

# Introduction

The relentless march of urbanization has profoundly reshaped human settlements, leading to an unprecedented expansion of transport infrastructure and mobility options within cities across the globe. As urban populations swell, metro systems have emerged as a cornerstone of modern urban transport, with a burgeoning number of cities either operating or actively planning to implement these high-capacity, rapid transit networks. These advanced public transport systems are often lauded for their efficiency, speed, and capacity to alleviate traffic congestion, thereby promising enhanced connectivity and accessibility for urban dwellers. However, a critical examination of transport equity reveals a more nuanced reality: the benefits of sophisticated transit services are not uniformly distributed across all segments of the population. The existing literature consistently underscores that different social strata experience and benefit from transit services in profoundly uneven ways, often exacerbating pre-existing inequalities rather than mitigating them.

Among the various demographic groups, women frequently encounter a distinct set of mobility challenges that are markedly different from those faced by men. These challenges are not merely logistical but are deeply rooted in societal norms, cultural expectations, and pervasive safety concerns. Issues such as voyeurism, various forms of sexual harassment, and even the lack of societal respect for basic needs like breastfeeding in public spaces, represent significant barriers to women’s unhindered use of public transport. A pervasive problem is the severe underreporting of these incidents, driven by a complex interplay of social norms, cultural pressures that often blame the victim, and a profound fear of stigma or reprisal. Consequently, these critical issues remain largely invisible to the very stakeholders who are in a position to effect change—namely, fellow passengers, transit operators, and policymakers. This invisibility is further compounded by limited attention from mainstream media, which often prioritizes other forms of urban news, leaving these gendered experiences largely unacknowledged and unaddressed. The problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where systemic issues such as inadequate surveillance infrastructure, insufficient policing, and a weaker rule of law further amplify women’s vulnerability and diminish their sense of safety and security in public transit environments.

Addressing this critical and pervasive gap in understanding and policy requires innovative approaches that can effectively capture and analyze the often-unspoken, realworld experiences of women within metro systems globally. The proposed research endeavors to tackle this challenge by employing a sophisticated social media analytics approach. This methodology is uniquely positioned to tap into the vast reservoirs of usergenerated content, offering an unprecedented opportunity to uncover authentic, unfiltered narratives that traditional survey methods or official reports frequently miss. Theoretically, this study aims to significantly contribute to the ongoing discourse on transport equity by bringing to the forefront the specific, gendered barriers that impede women’s mobility, thereby enriching our conceptual understanding of equitable urban transport. Methodologically, it pioneers a novel application of social media analytics within the domain of transport research, demonstrating its potential to yield granular insights into complex social phenomena. Empirically, the research is designed to generate a unique and invaluable dataset comprising gender-specific metro experiences, meticulously collected and contextualized across a diverse array of urban environments worldwide. Practically, the anticipated findings are poised to furnish policymakers and transit operators with concrete, actionable insights, enabling them to formulate and implement targeted interventions that will genuinely enhance safety, foster inclusivity, and promote equity within metro systems, ultimately creating more just and accessible urban spaces for all.

Achieving genuine transport equity is fundamentally contingent upon proactively addressing the multifaceted needs of socially disadvantaged groups, with women being a primary focus. A travel experience that is demonstrably safer and more inclusive has the transformative potential to significantly boost women’s mobility. This enhanced mobility in turn, serves as a powerful enabler, empowering women to more readily access vital employment opportunities, pursue educational aspirations, and engage more fully in social and civic life, both within their immediate urban environments and in broader regional contexts. From a broader societal perspective, the imperative to improve women’s experiences in public transit extends far beyond individual well-being; it directly supports overarching societal objectives of social inclusion and gender equality, contributing to the creation of more equitable and prosperous communities. Even in highly advanced economies, such as Japan and Hong Kong, where urban metro systems constitute the very backbone of the transport network, facilitating the vast majority of daily commutes, women frequently report persistent feelings of unsafety. These anxieties are particularly heightened during nighttime hours, in sparsely populated areas of stations or carriages, and on less-frequented lines, underscoring that even in highly developed systems, the perception of safety remains a critical gendered issue. Conversely, in cities where metro systems play a comparatively smaller role in the overall transport landscape and public transport usage is generally lower, a reduction in passenger volumes does not automatically translate into an increase in perceived or actual safety for women. In fact, a paradox often emerges where limited public surveillance, fewer witnesses, and a diminished sense of collective oversight can inadvertently heighten women’s vulnerability to various forms of harassment and other harmful acts, making these environments potentially more, rather than less, threatening. By systematically and rigorously tackling these intricate challenges, this research endeavors to deepen our collective understanding of the complex interplay between gender and mobility. Furthermore, it aims to inform the development of evidence-based interventions and

policies, ultimately contributing to the creation of urban environments that are not only safer and more equitable but also universally beneficial to society as a whole.

The proposed research introduces a groundbreaking methodological approach that strategically harnesses the immense potential of social media data to systematically uncover and analyze gendered experiences within metro systems across a diverse spectrum of global cities. This innovative strategy involves the meticulous collection and analysis of user-generated content from various social media platforms, employing a comprehensive set of keywords such as “metro” and other related terms, crucially translated and adapted for multiple languages to ensure broad cultural and linguistic coverage. The analytical framework will be guided by a predefined set of service quality dimensions, with a paramount focus on safety, which is consistently identified as a primary concern for women in public transit. To process this vast and complex dataset, advanced sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques will be rigorously applied to systematically compare and contrast the reported experiences of women and men. This comparative analysis will not only highlight disparities but also reveal nuanced differences in how safety and other service attributes are perceived and articulated by different genders. To further enrich these large-scale digital insights and gain a deeper, context-specific understanding, the research will incorporate in-depth case studies in three strategically selected Asian cities: tentatively, Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul. These cities represent a spectrum of economic development, cultural contexts, and metro system maturity, offering rich comparative potential. Within these case studies, the research will meticulously explore how women articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted within their specific socio-cultural milieu, and critically, how these perceptions directly relate to their actual travel behaviors and choices. By spatially mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces—that is, the geographical areas they frequent for daily activities—the study aims to empirically reveal how perceived or directly experienced barriers in metro transit restrict their access to essential urban opportunities, including employment, education, and social engagement. This robust mixed-method approach, which seamlessly integrates large-scale digital data analytics with granular urban transport research, is designed to generate actionable knowledge that is both theoretically profound and practically relevant for addressing gendered mobility barriers in urban environments.

The proposed solution represents a significant advancement over existing approaches to transport equity research, distinguished by three key innovations. Firstly, it leverages the power of social media analytics to unprecedented depths. By systematically mining and analyzing vast quantities of social media data, this research is uniquely positioned to uncover the often-unspoken realities of women’s experiences in public transit. This is particularly crucial in developing countries, where official reporting mechanisms for harassment and safety concerns are frequently scarce, unreliable, or culturally discouraged. The careful selection of cities across varying income levels, as measured by GDP per capita, and diverse gender inequality indices will ensure a truly global and representative perspective on gendered mobility barriers, moving beyond localized observations to identify broader patterns and context-specific nuances. Secondly, the research commits to developing customized large language models (LLMs). These bespoke LLMs will be specifically engineered to effectively clean, process, and interpret multilingual social media data. This tailored approach will enable more accurate sentiment analysis and a far more nuanced interpretation of gendered experiences across a multitude of diverse cultural and linguistic contexts, overcoming the limitations of generic, off-the-shelf models that may struggle with colloquialisms, slang, or culturally specific expressions of sentiment. Thirdly, the study integrates large-scale digital analytics with targeted, in-depth case studies. Through focused group discussions in the three selected Asian cities, the extensive digital data analysis will be complemented by rich qualitative insights. This mixed-method approach is designed to establish a direct and robust link between women’s reported metro experiences and their actual travel behavior, mobility patterns, and ultimately, their access to critical urban opportunities. Collectively, these innovations promise to yield richer, more comprehensive, and significantly more actionable insights than those attainable through traditional surveys or purely qualitative studies alone, thereby advancing both the theoretical understanding and practical application of gendered transport equity research.

# Gendered Barriers to Women’s Mobility in Public Transportation

The discourse surrounding urban mobility and public transportation has increasingly recognized that access and experience are not universal but are profoundly shaped by gender. Women, globally, face a distinct array of challenges that significantly impede their mobility in public transit systems, often leading to restricted access to essential urban opportunities. These barriers extend beyond mere logistical inconveniences, delving into deeply entrenched societal norms, pervasive safety concerns, and the emotional toll of navigating public spaces.

A significant body of research highlights that women’s mobility is often constrained by conservative norms and high crime rates, particularly in developing contexts. Field & Vyborny (2022), through experimental evidence from Lahore, Pakistan, compellingly demonstrates that reducing physical mobility constraints has a substantial positive impact on job searching for women. Their study reveals that women’s responsiveness is primarily driven by the availability of women-only transport services, strongly suggesting that safety and social acceptability, rather than solely cost, constitute key constraints. This finding underscores the critical importance of gender-segregated or women-focused transport solutions in environments where general public transport fails to provide adequate safety and comfort. Similarly, Mazumder & Pokharel (2018) identifies sexual violence on public transportation as a severe threat to women’s mobility in Bangladesh. They emphasize the extreme invisibility of this issue due to high rates of under-reporting, which not only confines women’s lives but also fosters a hostile environment detrimental to their empowerment. This under-reporting is a recurring theme, suggesting that official statistics often fail to capture the true extent of the problem, making it difficult for policymakers to acknowledge and address.

The emotional and psychological dimensions of women’s commutes are equally critical. Roy et al. (2024) delves into the “affects and emotions” of everyday commutes for women in Kolkata, using qualitative methods to explore how overcrowded, unsafe, and unreliable conditions trigger emotional ordeals. Their research reveals that these disruptive affects lead to increased travel time and costs, ultimately restricting mobility. The resulting sense of despair often compels women to adjust, accept, or even opt out of public transport, highlighting that emotional experiences are deeply entangled with accessibility, acceptability, and affordability. This perspective is vital for a feminist inquiry into gendered mobility inequalities, moving beyond mere physical barriers to encompass the lived emotional realities. In a similar vein, Zehba M. P. et al. (2025) explores “time poverty” among low-income women workers in Kochi, India, demonstrating how entrenched gender roles disproportionately burden women with unpaid domestic and caregiving responsibilities. This burden, exacerbated by travel constraints and inadequate access to transport services, leads to severe time poverty, significantly impacting their daily routines and quality of life. While not solely focused on safety, this study illustrates how broader societal expectations and transport system inefficiencies intersect to limit women’s mobility and access to opportunities.

Concerns about safety are not confined to developing nations but are a global phenomenon, even in countries with strong reputations for gender equality. Lindkvist (2024) investigates gendered mobility strategies in Sweden, a country often lauded for its gender equality policies. Despite policy recommendations and legislation, women continue to fear traveling by public transport and being out in the evenings. Her qualitative interviews reveal that women’s travel choices are profoundly affected by safety concerns, necessitating adaptations to situations perceived as threatening. This research challenges the “mythical mantra” of gender equality, demonstrating that patriarchal norms persist, delimiting women’s use and access to public space and transport even in advanced economies. This finding resonates with Ouali et al. (2020), who, using large-scale customer satisfaction data from 28 world cities, identifies a significant gender gap in the perception of safety, with women being $10 \%$ more likely than men to feel unsafe in metros ( $6 \%$ for buses). Their models indicate that more acts of violence, larger carriages, and emptier vehicles decrease women’s feeling of safety, suggesting that perceived vulnerability is heightened in less supervised or more isolated environments.

The pervasive nature of gender-based violence (GBV) on public transport is a recurring and deeply troubling theme. Infante-Vargas & Boyer (2021) provides a detailed account of GBV experienced by women using public transport in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico. Their mixed-method study reveals that violence is an everyday reality, leading to revictimization and profound psychological effects, extending beyond immediate physical harm to impose financial and emotional repercussions and severe limits on mobility. This comprehensive view underscores the far-reaching consequences of GBV. Similarly, King et al. (2021) examines women’s experiences of GBV and other threats to safety on public transport in Bangladesh. Their qualitative and quantitative analysis of 200 women reveals multiple threats, including GBV, harassment, crime, and traffic injuries, leading to high levels of anxiety and fear. Despite these dangers, women are often “captive travelers,” forced to prioritize price and availability over safety, and consequently resort to mitigating risks by altering travel patterns and restricting travel frequency. This highlights a critical dilemma where economic necessity overrides safety concerns, further entrenching inequalities.

The role of bystanders and community support in enhancing women’s safety is also gaining attention. Tilleman & Chowdhury (2024) explores how the presence of bystanders influences women’s sense of security and self-efficacy on public transport in

Auckland, New Zealand. Their survey findings suggest that bystander and community support are crucial expectations for women, significantly affecting their perception of security. The study advocates for strengthening anti-harassment strategies by building an active bystander community and fostering social norms that establish harassment as unacceptable. This shifts the focus from solely victim-blaming or individual coping mechanisms to a collective responsibility for creating safer public spaces. Furthermore, Shakibaei & Vorobjovas-Pinta (2022) extends the discussion to transgender and genderdiverse people, investigating their mobilities and access to leisure in Istanbul, Turkey. Their qualitative interviews reveal that these individuals face significant issues such as violence, discrimination, and harassment on public transport. The study concludes that driver training, education, and proactive messaging around gender minorities in public spaces could substantially improve comfort and safety for these vulnerable groups, broadening the scope of mobility justice beyond cisgender women.

The impact of these gendered barriers on women’s access to urban opportunities is profound. Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken (2020), examining sustainable transport and gender equity in Santiago, Chile, underlines how barriers linked to unsafe public transport environments directly limit women’s mobility and, consequently, their participation in economic and social life. They note that women account for a disproportionately high number of walking trips, which, while seemingly “sustainable,” often signifies inequalities in access to safer, more efficient modes of transport. This suggests that environmental and economic sustainability gains can come at a high social cost if gender equity is not explicitly addressed. The ethnographic account by Shakthi (2024), reviewing Romit Chowdhury’s “City of Men,” further illuminates the gendered dynamics of South Asian cities, particularly Kolkata. It explores how male transport workers’ negotiations with masculinity and everyday morality shape urban space, reinforcing patriarchal gender orders and making the city a heteronormative space. This perspective is crucial for understanding the systemic nature of gendered insecurity, as it highlights how masculinities and urbanism are deeply intertwined, influencing women’s experiences of public transport.

The challenges faced by women in public transport are multifaceted, encompassing direct experiences of violence and harassment, the emotional burden of navigating unsafe spaces, the constraints imposed by societal gender roles, and the systemic underreporting of these issues. These barriers collectively restrict women’s mobility, limiting their access to employment, education, and social opportunities, thereby perpetuating gender inequality. While traditional qualitative studies and surveys provide invaluable in-depth insights into these experiences, as seen in Roy et al. (2024), Lindkvist (2024), Asha et al. (2024), Zehba M. P. et al. (2025), King et al. (2021), and Infante-Vargas & Boyer (2021), they often face limitations in scale, real-time capture, and the ability to uncover unspoken or underreported incidents across diverse geographical contexts. The need for innovative methodologies that can overcome these limitations is evident, paving the way for approaches that can systematically analyze large-scale, real-world data to inform more effective policy interventions.

# The Role of Social Media Analytics in Understanding Public Perceptions

In an increasingly digitalized world, social media platforms have transformed into vast, dynamic repositories of public opinion, offering an unprecedented opportunity to capture real-time, unfiltered insights into societal issues. This phenomenon has given rise to social media analytics (SMA) as a powerful methodology for understanding public perceptions, especially in domains where traditional data collection methods fall short. The application of SMA in transport research, particularly concerning sensitive topics like gendered experiences, presents a groundbreaking avenue for uncovering previously invisible realities.

The utility of social media analytics in generating comprehensive insights for strategic decision-making has been widely recognized across various sectors. Nugroho & Angela (2024), for instance, demonstrates the significant impact of SMA on strategic decisionmaking in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), highlighting its role in enhancing organizational innovation and adaptability. While their focus is on business, the underlying principle—that social media generates valuable, actionable intelligence—is directly transferable to public policy and urban planning. The sheer volume and immediacy of social media data offer a distinct advantage over traditional surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to social desirability bias, particularly when addressing sensitive topics like harassment.

Social media provides an enormous public repository of textual data from which valuable information can be extracted, allowing firms and, by extension, public entities to gain business intelligence. Hu et al. (2019) illustrates this by developing a text analytics framework that integrates consumer-, employee-, and firm-generated content from social media to measure brand personality, achieving high prediction accuracy. This demonstrates the capability of SMA to synthesize diverse textual data sources into coherent, actionable insights. In the context of public transportation, this means analyzing user-generated content to understand perceptions of service quality, safety, and inclusivity from multiple perspectives.

The ability of SMA to elicit public opinion about predefined topics has been explored by Thelwall (2017), who investigates its potential and limitations for YouTube comments. Their study shows that SMA can identify plausible patterns of subtopic difference, gender, and sentiment, while also acknowledging the inherently exploratory and multimethod nature of such analyses. This highlights both the promise of SMA in revealing nuanced patterns and the necessity for careful methodological design to address its inherent limitations, such as data noise and representativeness.

Specifically within the realm of public transportation, social media data has proven to be an invaluable resource for understanding customer satisfaction and perceptions. Luo et al. (2023) leverages crowdsourced data from Sina Weibo to capture the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction of transit services across individuals, space, and time. Their study applies sentiment analysis to measure customer satisfaction across various service attributes, including safety, crowdedness, reliability, personnel behavior, and comfort. A key finding relevant to the proposed research is the identification of highly polarized

online sentiment and the explicit revelation of gendered attitudes, underscoring the potential of SMA to uncover gender-specific experiences. This work demonstrates how social media can compensate for traditional public attitude surveys by providing highvolume semantic, spatial, and temporal information.

Further emphasizing the gendered dimension, Luo & He (2021) specifically investigates gender differences in perceptions toward transit services in Shenzhen, China, using a social media mining approach. Their analysis of Weibo microblogs reveals a distinct gender gap, with nearly $74 \%$ of posts related to transit services being from women. Crucially, women tend to express greater concern about the comfort of the transit environment, including temperature, crowdedness, and safety, particularly at night, whereas men show more interest in e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. This study provides a robust methodological framework for investigating gendered, subjective travel experiences through social media mining, offering an innovative way to gather customer service feedback and build more inclusive service systems. The ability to identify such specific gendered concerns through unsolicited online discourse is a significant advantage over traditional methods that might not prompt such detailed or candid responses.

The real-time nature of social media data also allows for dynamic monitoring and management of urban services. Luo & He (2020) proposes a framework for integrating quantitative and qualitative analyses of Sina Weibo data to investigate perceptions of metro services in Shenzhen. Their research identifies clear temporal variations among different service attributes and reveals spatial variations around central business districts and transport hubs for issues like crowdedness and waiting times. Importantly, microblogs reporting on perceptions of safety and personnel behavior present different spatial patterns, suggesting that these issues are not uniformly distributed but are contextdependent. This capability to identify key service areas for immediate improvement and to monitor metro systems effectively over the long term is a powerful practical implication of SMA.

However, the application of social media analytics is not without its challenges. Issues such as data accuracy, privacy concerns, and the dynamic nature of social media platforms require careful consideration, as highlighted by R. H. Chowdhury (2024) in the context of brand management. While SMA offers valuable data on consumer interactions and sentiment, the representativeness of social media users and the potential for echo chambers or biased reporting must be acknowledged. Despite these limitations, the sheer volume and immediacy of social media data, coupled with advancements in analytical techniques, make it an indispensable tool for understanding complex social phenomena.

The emergence of deep learning (DL) has further amplified the capabilities of social media analytics. Hayat et al. (2019) discusses the prospects of deep learning for SMA, noting its significant processing power for tasks like text processing, which is crucial for analyzing the exponential development and widespread availability of digital social media data. DL architectures offer appropriate solutions to the challenges of scalability, heterogeneity, and multimodality inherent in social media data, enabling more sophisticated analyses than traditional tools. This integration of DL with SMA is critical for extracting nuanced insights from unstructured textual data, moving beyond simple keyword searches to understand sentiment, emotions, and complex narratives.

In summary, social media analytics offers a powerful, scalable, and real-time approach to understanding public perceptions of urban transit services, with a particular strength in uncovering gendered experiences that are often underreported through conventional channels. Studies by Luo et al. (2023) and Luo & He (2021) explicitly demonstrate its capacity to reveal gender-specific concerns regarding safety and comfort in public transport. While challenges related to data quality and representativeness exist, the methodological advancements, especially with the integration of deep learning, position SMA as a crucial tool for informing policy decisions aimed at enhancing transport equity and inclusivity.

# Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Deeper Insights

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, offering unprecedented capabilities for understanding, generating, and interpreting human language. Their application in social media analytics, particularly for uncovering nuanced and often unspoken gendered experiences in public transportation, represents a significant methodological leap beyond traditional text analysis techniques. LLMs possess the ability to process vast amounts of multilingual, unstructured data, enabling more accurate sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and contextual interpretation, which are critical for this research.

Traditional sentiment analysis, while useful, often struggles with the complexities of human language, including sarcasm, irony, cultural nuances, and domain-specific jargon. LLMs, with their deep learning architectures and extensive pre-training on massive text corpora, can overcome many of these limitations. Radwan et al. (2024), for instance, proposes a novel approach utilizing LLMs, specifically OpenAI’s GPT-3 embeddings, combined with machine learning algorithms to classify social media posts indicative of stress disorders. Their top model achieved $8 3 \%$ accuracy, demonstrating the power of LLM embeddings to transform textual data into vector representations that capture semantic meaning and linguistic nuances more effectively than previous methods. This capability is directly applicable to identifying subtle expressions of fear, discomfort, or harassment in women’s social media posts about metro experiences, which might otherwise be missed by simpler keyword- or rule-based sentiment analysis.

The ability of LLMs to handle multilingual data is particularly pertinent for a global study on metro systems. Social media content is inherently multilingual, reflecting the diverse linguistic landscapes of urban populations. Developing customized LLMs, as proposed by this research, allows for the cleaning and processing of data in multiple languages, ensuring that gendered experiences from various cultural contexts are accurately captured and interpreted. This is a significant advantage over approaches that might be limited to English or a few dominant languages, potentially overlooking critical insights from non-English speaking communities. The development of such models is supported by advancements in the field, where models like BLIP-2 (J. Li et al., 2023), MiniGPT-v2 (Chen et al., 2023), and mPLUG-Owl2 (Ye et al., 2024) demonstrate the power of bootstrapping vision-language pre-training and multi-modal capabilities,

indicating the feasibility of building specialized LLMs for complex, multi-modal data analysis. While these specific models focus on vision-language tasks, their underlying principles of leveraging frozen pre-trained models and developing efficient pre-training strategies are highly relevant for building customized LLMs for text-based social media analytics across diverse languages.

Furthermore, LLMs excel at understanding context and generating coherent narratives, which is crucial for interpreting the qualitative aspects of social media posts. The OpenAssistant Conversations corpus (Köpf et al., 2023), a human-generated, humanannotated assistant-style conversation corpus in 35 different languages, exemplifies the effort to align LLMs with human preferences and improve their usability across various domains. This kind of resource and the underlying alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are instrumental in developing LLMs that can accurately interpret the nuanced expressions of safety concerns, harassment, and discomfort in user-generated content, even when these are not explicitly stated. By training customized LLMs on domainspecific data and incorporating human feedback, the models can become highly adept at identifying and categorizing gendered experiences with greater precision and contextual awareness.

The integration of NLP and deep learning techniques with social media analytics has been a growing trend, as highlighted by Hayat et al. (2019), who discusses how deep learning architectures are appropriate solutions for handling the scalability, heterogeneity, and multimodality of social media data. This synergy allows for more sophisticated analyses, moving beyond surface-level sentiment to uncover deeper insights into user emotions and perceptions. Alharbi & Haq (2024), for instance, demonstrates the effectiveness of the DistilBERT model in classifying tweets related to disasters, achieving high predictive accuracy. This showcases the practical advantages of advanced transformer models in emergency management and public safety, a domain that shares similarities with public transport safety in terms of real-time monitoring and rapid response needs. The ability of such models to maintain high performance with reduced computational size and improved processing speed makes them ideal for large-scale, realtime social media analysis.

Moreover, the capacity of LLMs to integrate different modalities of data, as suggested by S et al. (2025), who advocates for an architecture unifying NLP for text-based content and deep learning for visual data into emotion categorization, offers future potential. While the current research proposal focuses primarily on textual data, the ability of LLMs to process multimodal content (e.g., images or videos accompanying text posts) could further enrich the analysis of gendered experiences, providing a more holistic understanding of the context surrounding reported incidents. This research, by focusing on text, lays a foundational step towards such comprehensive multimodal analysis.

In the context of brand management, R. H. Chowdhury (2024) emphasizes the critical role of sentiment analysis, utilizing NLP and machine learning algorithms, in providing insights into consumer attitudes and emotional responses. This enables brands to refine marketing strategies based on real-time feedback. Similarly, in transport research, LLMpowered sentiment analysis can provide transit operators with real-time feedback on

women’s safety concerns, allowing for proactive adjustments to services, infrastructure, or policing strategies. The challenges identified by Chowdhury, such as data accuracy, privacy issues, and the dynamic nature of social media, remain pertinent. However, the advanced capabilities of LLMs offer robust tools to mitigate some of these, for example, by improving the accuracy of sentiment detection and by providing more nuanced interpretations that can better filter noise.

The application of LLMs in social media analytics for understanding public concerns, as demonstrated by Maghsoudi et al. (2024) in the context of AI, further underscores their utility. Their study identified seven distinct clusters of concerns from Twitter data, encompassing privacy, workforce displacement, and ethical implications. This multistage methodology, combining large-scale social media data collection with advanced text analytics, provides a blueprint for how LLMs can be used to systematically explore complex public apprehensions. In the context of women’s mobility, LLMs can help identify not just explicit reports of harassment but also underlying concerns related to lack of transparency, dependency on public transport, or social and ethical implications of unsafe environments.

In conclusion, leveraging LLMs for social media analytics offers a powerful and sophisticated approach to uncover gendered experiences in metro transit. Their ability to handle multilingual data, capture semantic nuances, interpret complex sentiments, and process vast datasets efficiently surpasses traditional methods. While challenges related to data quality and ethical considerations persist, the continuous advancements in LLM technology provide robust tools to address these, enabling a deeper, more accurate, and globally representative understanding of the barriers to women’s mobility. This methodological innovation is crucial for translating raw social media data into actionable insights for policymakers and transit operators.

# Integrating Digital Analytics with Case Studies for Actionable Insights

While large-scale digital analytics, particularly through social media data and advanced LLMs, offers unparalleled breadth and real-time insights into gendered mobility barriers, its true power is realized when integrated with in-depth qualitative case studies. This mixed-method approach provides a crucial bridge between macro-level patterns identified in vast datasets and the micro-level lived experiences and contextual nuances that inform policy and practice. The proposed research, by combining social media analytics with focused group discussions in specific Asian cities, aims to generate knowledge that is not only statistically robust but also deeply contextualized and actionable.

The strength of qualitative research lies in its ability to delve into the “why” and “how” of human experiences, capturing rich narratives and emotional dimensions that quantitative data alone might miss. Several studies in the existing literature exemplify the profound insights gained from qualitative methods in understanding women’s mobility challenges. For instance, Roy et al. (2024)’s qualitative research in Kolkata, using indepth interviews and visual surveys, moves beyond simply identifying barriers to comprehending how “affects and emotions” shape accessibility, acceptability, and affordability of public transport for women. Their findings on the “disruptive affects” and “emotional ordeals” that compel women to adjust or opt out of public transport provide a nuanced understanding that is critical for designing truly inclusive systems. Similarly, Lindkvist (2024)’s qualitative interviews in Sweden reveal how women’s travel choices are profoundly affected by safety concerns, leading to necessary adaptations despite the country’s reputation for gender equality. These studies underscore the importance of understanding the subjective experiences and coping mechanisms of women, which are often deeply personal and context-dependent.

The proposed mixed-method approach seeks to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. Large-scale social media analytics, powered by LLMs, can identify prevalent themes, sentiment trends, and geographical hotspots of concern related to women’s safety in metro systems across multiple cities. This digital data provides a broad, quantitative overview, highlighting where and when issues are most frequently discussed and the general sentiment surrounding them. However, to understand why these issues arise, how they are experienced, and what their specific impacts are on women’s daily lives and access to opportunities, qualitative case studies become indispensable. For example, while social media might indicate a high volume of negative sentiment related to “crowdedness” in Delhi metros, focused group discussions can uncover the specific ways in which crowdedness translates into feelings of unsafety, opportunities for harassment, and the strategies women employ to navigate such environments.

The in-depth case studies in Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul, as outlined in the abstract, serve this precise purpose. These cities represent diverse urban contexts, ranging from a highly developed transit-oriented city like Hong Kong, where public transport forms the backbone of daily trips (He et al., 2023), to rapidly developing cities like Delhi, which face immense population pressures and infrastructure challenges. By exploring how women in these specific contexts articulate their perceptions of safety, how these perceptions are interpreted within their unique socio-cultural frameworks, and how they relate to actual travel behaviors, the research can provide granular, actionable insights. For instance, King et al. (2021)’s study in Bangladesh, which combined qualitative and quantitative data, revealed that women were “captive travelers” making transport choices based on price and availability rather than safety, and actively mitigated risks by changing travel patterns. Such insights into behavioral adaptations are crucial for policy, and a mixed-method approach can validate and deepen these findings across a broader spectrum of cities.

Moreover, mapping these concerns onto women’s activity spaces—a key component of the proposed case studies—allows for a direct link between perceived or experienced barriers and their tangible impact on access to urban opportunities like employment and education. This spatial analysis, informed by qualitative narratives, can reveal how fear or actual incidents in metro transit create “no-go zones” or restrict travel during certain hours, thereby limiting women’s participation in the urban economy and social life. Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken (2020), in their study of Santiago, Chile, highlights how barriers linked to unsafe public transport environments directly limit women’s mobility and participation, often leading to a disproportionately high number of walking trips, which, while seemingly sustainable, indicates significant inequalities in access. The proposed mixed-method approach can empirically demonstrate these links by connecting digital sentiment to observed or reported travel behaviors and activity patterns.

The integration of digital analytics with case studies also addresses the limitations inherent in each method when used in isolation. Purely qualitative studies, while rich in detail, often lack generalizability and scalability. Conversely, large-scale digital analytics, while providing breadth, can sometimes miss the underlying motivations, emotional depth, and specific contextual factors that drive public sentiment. By combining them, the research gains both extensive coverage and intensive depth. For example, InfanteVargas & Boyer (2021)’s mixed-method study in Saltillo, Mexico, detailing the pervasiveness of gender-based violence and its wide-reaching effects, demonstrates how combining survey data with interviews can provide a comprehensive understanding of a complex issue. The proposed research extends this by incorporating the even larger scale and real-time nature of social media data.

Furthermore, the development of customized LLMs for multilingual data processing, as highlighted in the abstract, is particularly beneficial for the case studies. It ensures that the nuances of local languages and cultural expressions of safety concerns are accurately captured and interpreted, preventing misinterpretations that could arise from generic language models. This meticulous approach to language and culture is essential for generating truly actionable insights that are relevant to the specific contexts of Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul.

In essence, the integration of large-scale digital analytics with in-depth case studies represents a robust methodological framework for advancing gendered transport equity research. It allows for the identification of broad patterns and trends from social media data, which are then enriched and validated by the detailed, contextual insights derived from qualitative investigations. This synergistic approach ensures that the findings are not only comprehensive and globally informed but also deeply rooted in the lived realities of women, providing policymakers and transit operators with the nuanced understanding required to implement effective, targeted interventions that foster safer, more inclusive, and equitable urban environments.

# Conclusion

The pervasive issue of gendered barriers to women’s mobility in metro transit systems represents a critical challenge to achieving transport equity and broader social inclusion in urban environments worldwide. The literature consistently demonstrates that women face unique and often underreported challenges, including voyeurism, sexual harassment, and a general sense of unsafety, which significantly restrict their access to employment, education, and social opportunities (Field & Vyborny, 2022; Infante-Vargas & Boyer, 2021; King et al., 2021; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018; Ouali et al., 2020). These challenges are exacerbated by social norms, cultural pressures, and fear of stigma, leading to a profound underreporting that renders these experiences largely invisible to policymakers and transit operators, particularly in developing countries where surveillance and policing may be inadequate (King et al., 2021; Mazumder & Pokharel, 2018). Studies from diverse geographical contexts, including Pakistan (Field & Vyborny, 2022), Kolkata (Roy et al., 2024; Shakthi, 2024), Sweden (Lindkvist, 2024), Bangladesh (Asha et al., 2024; King et al., 2021), Kochi (Zehba M. P. et al., 2025), Saltillo (InfanteVargas & Boyer, 2021), Istanbul (Shakibaei & Vorobjovas-Pinta, 2022), and a range of global cities (Ouali et al., 2020), collectively underscore the universal nature of these

gendered mobility constraints, even in societies with strong gender equality reputations. The emotional toll, time poverty, and the necessity for women to adapt their travel behaviors or even forgo public transit altogether highlight the profound impact on their well-being and life chances (King et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2024; Zehba M. P. et al., 2025).

Traditional research methods, while providing invaluable in-depth qualitative insights into these experiences, often face limitations in terms of scale, real-time data capture, and the ability to uncover the vast, often unspoken, realities across diverse urban contexts. This is where the innovative application of social media analytics (SMA) emerges as a powerful solution. The literature on SMA demonstrates its capacity to capture real-time public opinion, generate comprehensive insights, and identify nuanced patterns that traditional surveys might miss (R. H. Chowdhury, 2024; Hu et al., 2019; Nugroho & Angela, 2024; Thelwall, 2017). Crucially, studies by Luo et al. (2023) and Luo & He (2021) have specifically highlighted the utility of social media mining in uncovering gendered attitudes and perceptions towards transit services, revealing distinct gender gaps in concerns related to safety, comfort, and crowdedness. This capability to analyze highvolume, semantic, spatial, and temporal information from user-generated content offers a dynamic approach to understanding public sentiment and identifying areas for improvement in urban transit systems (Luo & He, 2020).

Further enhancing the capabilities of social media analytics is the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs represent a significant methodological advancement, offering unprecedented power to process vast amounts of multilingual, unstructured textual data with greater accuracy and contextual understanding than previous NLP techniques. Their ability to capture semantic meaning, linguistic nuances, and even subtle emotional cues from social media posts, as demonstrated in applications ranging from stress disorder classification (Radwan et al., 2024) to disaster response (Alharbi & Haq, 2024), is critical for interpreting the complex and often indirect expressions of gendered experiences. The development of customized LLMs, tailored to specific cultural and linguistic contexts, can overcome the limitations of generic models, ensuring a more accurate and nuanced interpretation of diverse global experiences (Chen et al., 2023; Köpf et al., 2023; J. Li et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2024). This technological leap allows for a deeper dive into the “unspoken realities” that are central to understanding women’s mobility barriers.

The proposed research addresses a significant gap by integrating these cutting-edge digital analytics with in-depth qualitative case studies. While SMA and LLMs provide broad, scalable insights into patterns and trends, qualitative methods offer the necessary depth and contextual understanding of lived experiences. Studies like those by Roy et al. (2024), Lindkvist (2024), Asha et al. (2024), Zehba M. P. et al. (2025), King et al. (2021), and Infante-Vargas & Boyer (2021), which employ qualitative approaches, underscore the importance of understanding the “why” and “how” behind women’s perceptions and behavioral adaptations. By combining large-scale social media analysis with focused group discussions in cities like Hong Kong, Delhi, and Seoul, the research can directly link digital insights to actual travel behaviors, mobility patterns, and the tangible impact on women’s access to urban opportunities. This mixed-method approach ensures that the findings are not only statistically robust but also deeply contextualized and actionable for policymakers and transit operators.

In summary, the existing literature clearly establishes the pervasive nature of gendered barriers to women’s mobility in public transit and highlights the limitations of traditional reporting mechanisms. The advancements in social media analytics and Large Language Models offer a transformative opportunity to uncover these underreported experiences at an unprecedented scale and depth. By systematically leveraging these technologies and integrating them with targeted qualitative case studies, the proposed research is uniquely positioned to generate comprehensive, actionable insights.

Research Gaps and Future Directions: Despite the significant progress in understanding gendered mobility, several research gaps remain that the proposed approach directly addresses and also opens avenues for future inquiry. (1)

Underreporting and Invisibility: The most critical gap is the persistent underreporting of harassment and safety concerns, especially in developing countries. Traditional surveys often fail to capture these sensitive issues comprehensively. Social media analytics, by tapping into unsolicited, real-time narratives, directly tackles this invisibility, providing a more authentic representation of women’s experiences. Future research could focus on validating the representativeness of social media data against official reports or targeted surveys in specific contexts to quantify the extent of underreporting. (2) Multilingual and Cross-Cultural Nuances: Existing studies often focus on specific regions or languages. The proposed development of customized LLMs for multilingual data processing is crucial for a truly global perspective. Future work could further refine these LLMs to capture highly localized slang, idioms, and culturally specific expressions of discomfort or fear, which are vital for nuanced interpretation. Comparative studies across a wider range of cities with varying socio-cultural contexts would also be beneficial to understand the universality versus specificity of these barriers. (3) Linking Perception to Behavior and Opportunity: While studies have shown that safety concerns impact mobility, a direct, large-scale empirical link between perceived barriers (as expressed online) and actual travel behaviors, mobility patterns, and access to urban opportunities is often inferred rather than directly measured. The mixed-method approach, combining digital analytics with case studies and activity space mapping, aims to solidify this link. Future research could explore longitudinal studies to track how changes in perceived safety (e.g., after policy interventions) correlate with changes in women’s travel patterns and access to opportunities over time. (4) Actionable Policy Insights: While many studies identify problems, the translation of findings into concrete, actionable policy recommendations is often challenging. The proposed research’s focus on generating actionable insights for policymakers and transit operators is a key strength. Future work could involve co-creation workshops with transit authorities and women’s advocacy groups, using the research findings to collaboratively design and pilot interventions, and then using social media analytics for real-time monitoring of their effectiveness. (5) Ethical Considerations of Social Media Data: The use of social media data raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, data security, and potential biases in online discourse. While not explicitly detailed in the abstract, these are critical for any social media analytics project. Future research must rigorously address these ethical dimensions, developing robust protocols for data anonymization, user consent (where feasible), and bias mitigation in LLM training and analysis. (6) Beyond Cisgender Women: While the focus is on women, the experiences of transgender and gender-diverse individuals in public transport are also critical, as highlighted by

Shakibaei & Vorobjovas-Pinta (2022). Future research could expand the scope to explicitly include these groups, using social media analytics to uncover their unique mobility barriers and contribute to a more inclusive understanding of transport equity.

By systematically addressing these gaps, this research will not only deepen our theoretical understanding of gender and mobility but also provide evidence-based interventions to create safer, more equitable urban environments that benefit society as a whole. The innovative methodological framework, leveraging the power of social media analytics and large language models, offers a promising path forward for transforming urban transit into truly inclusive public spaces.
