## 1 INTRODUCTION

A highly interdisciplinary field, travel behaviour research depends heavily on empirical data to represent human mobility. Guided by theories of time geography, transport geography and behavioural science (Hägerstrand, 1970; Pred, 1967, 1977; Ajzen, 1991; Van Acker et al., 2010), this research arena has become increasingly active in recent years due to the increased availability and diversity of data, which fuel the development of new analytical methods and theories. Various data sources have been utilised in the travel behaviour literature. Roughly speaking, there are the 'conventional data' (e.g., household travel surveys, questionnaires) and the 'new and emerging data' (e.g., mobile phone data, smart card data, social media data). Although there is no specific time stamp for the first appearance of so-called ‘new and emerging data', this term has an increasingly close connection with 'smart cities'.

The term 'smart cities' was coined around 2005, and has various definitions (Townsend, 2013; Picon, 2015; Gassmann et al., 2019). Common terms invoked to describe smart cities include information communication and technology (ICT), digitalisation, sensor, network and connectivity, big data and cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and digital twins. These concepts represent a suite of resources and tools that can be used to achieve the goals of addressing current challenges in urban management, building more sustainable cities and improving residents’ quality of life. Other new technologies and initiatives in smart cities include 5G technology, blockchain technology, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), new low-carbon energy technologies, sharing services and open data platforms. All of these changes have impacted urban mobility and people's travel behaviour.

Despite the strong linkages, there has been little discussion about the intersection between smart cities, future/emerging transport and new/emerging data. We argue that certain challenges associated with the data for travel behaviour research are associated with and can be addressed via smart city projects and initiatives. By establishing smart cities as the backdrop, we can better engage in discourse about the challenges and opportunities for travel behaviour data in connection with smart cities, where future and emerging transport modes co-exist with traditional transport modes and conventional and new/ emerging data complement each other (Figure 11.1).

In the era of smart cities, people, vehicles, infrastructure and the built environment are becoming increasingly inter-connected and communicative. ICT advances have changed how people travel and conduct out-of-home activities. In the past decade, urban transport systems have undergone unprecedented transformations, producing several emerging and anticipated trends in mobility solutions (Cassetta et al., 2017). These include clean fuel vehicles (electric and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles), autonomous vehicles, e-micromobility devices (e.g., e-scooters and e-bikes), bike-sharing, ride-hailing and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) (Litman, 2021). Meanwhile, traditional transport modes (urban rail, tram, bus, car, cycling, walking) in existing networks continue to serve most trips in cities. These trends collectively require that transport systems offer more integrated, real-time responsive and energy-efficient operations and enhanced long-term planning efficiency (Kuo et al., 2023). This also demands that new data sources can provide real-time and comprehensive information for different forms of mobility.

Figure 11.1 Links between smart cities, transport and data

The new and emerging data engendered by the profusion of ICT and penetration of emerging transport modes has produced opportunities to better capture and understand human mobility over a range of spatial and temporal granularities. However, this also produces questions about making full use of these data and imputing travel behavioural information that can complement findings from traditional household travel surveys. Recent years have witnessed the appearance of numerous edited works and comprehensive literature reviews devoted to the application of 'big data' in the context of travel behaviour or urban transport research (e.g., He et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016; Tao et al., 2021). To build on these works, this chapter utilises various data to review the latest research and help advance our understanding of travel behaviour. This process also enables identification of the limitations of these data, leading to suggested avenues for further research. Meanwhile, and perhaps more importantly, this chapter will also discuss the developments in smart cities projects that will continue to generate data with substantial research value.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the conventional data sources for travel behaviour research. Section 3 elaborates on the importance of new and emerging data in the era of smart cities. Section 4 discusses the application of different new/emerging data in the study of travel behaviour. Section 5 discusses the challenges and opportunities for applying new/emerging data, and Section 6 draws some conclusions.

## 2 CONVENTIONAL DATA SOURCES FOR TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR

Conventional data sources include four main types, summarised in Table 11.1. The first is large-scale household travel surveys. Some of the best-known surveys are at the national level, with examples including the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) in the US, the National Travel Survey (NTS) in the UK, the Nationwide Person Trip Survey (NPTS) in Japan and the Mobility in Germany (MiD) travel survey. Some regional household surveys also contain comprehensive data for travel behaviour research, such as the Puget Sound Travel Survey (PSTS) in Washington State. Such sources offer the advantage of providing rich information about personal and household characteristics and trip details that can be used to study various topics, with extant research including investigations of trip frequency, travel mode choice, route choice, departure time choice, destination choice and travel companions (Murray-Tuite and Mahmassani, 2003; Papinski et al., 2009; Scott and He, 2012; He, 2013a, 2013b; He and Giuliano, 2017).

Table 11.1 Advantages and shortcomings of conventional data sources and potential solutions

<table><tr><td>Source</td><td>Advantages</td><td>Shortcomings</td><td>Potential Solutions</td></tr><tr><td>Large-scale household travel surveys</td><td>Rich data on personal and household characteristics and trip details</td><td>High collection cost, subject to memory loss, short time span</td><td>Using trajectory data (e.g., mobile phone) to record trip information</td></tr><tr><td>Small-scale questionnaire surveys</td><td>Can include tailor- made questions (e.g., attitudinal inquiries)</td><td>Sample bias, subject to memory loss, short time span</td><td>Combining online platform and on-set surveys to collect attitudinal information</td></tr><tr><td>Questionnaires with GPS tracking</td><td>Rich and accurate geographic data on route choice and travel behaviour</td><td>Relatively high collection cost, short time span</td><td>Using smart devices (e.g., mobile phone) to record trip information</td></tr><tr><td>Time use data</td><td>Continuous information about time spent on daily activities over short period (e.g., 1-2 days)</td><td>Lack of location information, limited socio-demographic information, short time span</td><td>Using online platforms to collect personal information</td></tr></table>

The second type of source is small-scale questionnaire survey data, which includes datasets ranging from a few dozen to a few thousand records. Such surveys often ask respondents to record their trips retrospectively, or to simply record their travel destination at the zonal level or on a more detailed level (e.g., address, geographic coordinates). However, because location information (such as home address) is sensitive, some surveys may avoid very detailed questions or use coarser scales (e.g., postcode) for location-based questions. This type of data has the advantage of being able to include tailor-made questions about, for example, attitudes towards certain travel behaviours or transport modes, such as attitudes towards public transport and cars in the work of $\mathrm{{He}}$ and Thogersen (2017).

The third type of data combines collection via questionnaire survey and Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking, which requires respondents to carry a device with a GPS tracking function or location-based sensor (e.g., GPS-enabled devices). In the earlier days of GPS-enabled travel diaries, sample sizes were usually relatively small (perhaps fewer than 50 individuals or vehicles) and tracking durations were also usually limited, for example, up to 24-48 hours (Papinski et al., 2009). Such data are particularly useful for studying route choice behaviour in relation to transport networks. Meanwhile, because GPS carriers (survey respondents) are usually asked to also provide socioeconomic and demographic information, it can be considered an integration of small and big data.

The fourth type is time use data, which provide a detailed breakdown of activity type in 15-minute windows over a continuous span of 24 or 48 hours. Similar to household travel surveys, many countries - including the US, the UK, Germany and Japan - conduct time use surveys in comparable formats. Among the drawbacks of time use surveys is that they lack location information and provide limited personal and household information, thus constraining application in travel behaviour research. However, the detailed breakdowns make time use datasets valuable for examining inequality issues among marginalised groups, such as elderly and LGBTQ+ populations (Spinney et al., 2009; He et al., 2022a; Smart et al., 2017).

## 3 NEW AND EMERGING DATA FOR TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR IN THE ERA OF SMART CITIES

Moving beyond the conventional data, new and emerging data have attracted keen interest due to their relevance to emerging/future transport and the advantages associated with big data, a category to which many of these data types pertain.

The development of smart cities is driven mainly by digital technology and innovation, and relies heavily on the advancement and adoption of ICT (Townsend, 2013; Gassmann et al., 2019). Because of the importance of networks, ICT, and commuting power in smart cities, big tech firms and corporations - including IBM, Cisco, Siemens and Microsoft - have been involved in transforming cities into smart cities. In return, these tech giants obtain and make use of the data generated by smart cities via their advanced standing in the world of data analytics. Popular websites such as Google, Twitter and Foursquare not only provide services but also utilise their platform and user data to understand consumer preferences and behaviour.

The data generated by smart cities are large scale and diverse due to the various sensors stationed at numerous nodes and links in the networked cities. In theory, all vehicles and humans can carry sensors capable of capturing motion. With the latest network technology (e.g., 5G), the mobility patterns captured by urban sensors can be projected in a control room to monitor a city's performance, not to mention the function of transport systems and the travel behaviour of individuals. However, due to various challenges and concerns about, for example, privacy and public acceptance, only a fraction of the urban population and a city's vehicles have their movement and details recorded.

As in the case of conventional data, the representativeness of new and emerging types of data remains an important issue. Generally, representativeness depends on the market share of the service provider. We have observed that an increasing number of travel behaviour studies have utilised datasets provided by or scraped from some of the leading companies in the technology and innovation industries, such as Google, Tom Tom, Uber, Didi Chuxing, Twitter and Foursquare. Some service providers are more localised, as in the case of mobile telecommunication companies such as China Telecom and social media platforms such as Weibo (the Chinese version of Twitter).

In general, the main advantages of big data are represented by the five Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value (Manyika et al., 2011). These link to another important aspect of travel behaviour research - generalisability - particularly when data analytics involves AI and machine learning. Such methods provide calculation and prediction capabilities that are more advanced than those enabled by conventional statistical models (Elith et al., 2008). For example, an IBM campaign for SmartCloud and Smarter Cities Intelligent Operations software includes an infographic claiming that 'smarter cities [turn] big data into insight' (Picon, 2015, p. 49). This has profound implications for the relationship between data and AI. In the era of smart cities, AI and machine learning models rely on large sets of training data as a large and representative dataset will hopefully improve model performance and produce more generalisable parameters.

## 4 APPLICATIONS OF NEW AND EMERGING DATA IN TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH

### 4.1 GPS and Trajectory Data

Sharing of services (or the sharing economy) is among the new initiatives associated with smart cities (Picon, 2015). This concept depends on platforms that facilitate real-time (or near real-time) matching of the supply of and demand for services. To enable easy access and save time, location information (of suppliers and consumers) is critical to the functioning of many types of sharing services, which aim to maximise resource utilisation and reduce the vacant/idle time of services. Nonetheless, Hägerstrand's (1970) time geography and space-time analysis remains applicable in the sharing economy: for a match to be made, the space and time windows of both supplier and consumer must align. ICT, including location-enabled technologies such as GPS, along with mobile applications offering diverse mobility services and high-speed telecommunication networks, facilitate the synchronisation of space and time. This enables the viability of various sharing and emerging mobility services. These mobility services include ride-hailing (or ride-sourcing) offered by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft, bike-sharing and e-scooter sharing.

Considering these shared transport modes, several travel behaviour studies have used GPS data to focus on typical issues that form the foundation of transport demand modelling and prediction - such as trip number/usage (Wang and Noland, 2021), trip purpose (Dias et al., 2019; Hossain and Habib, 2021), route choice (Scott et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) and destination choice (Lazarus et al., 2020). Furthermore, some studies have analysed the GPS data of these shared mobilities to explore key questions that have not been extensively examined in the context of traditional transport research. These include integration with traditional travel modes, especially for micro-mobilities that can serve as first-/last-mile solutions (e.g., bike and e-scooter sharing) (Guo and He, 2020; Luo et al., 2021), and the potential substitution/complement effect of alternative (traditional or emerging) transport modes (Nie, 2017; Luo et al., 2021). For example, Guo and He used GPS data from OFO (one of China's leading bike-sharing companies before it declared bankruptcy) to propose a methodology for examining the level of integration between dockless bike-sharing and Shenzhen's metro system.

GPS and trajectory data have also been used to examine the integration of shared mobility with other urban infrastructures. For example, Zuniga-Garcia et al. (2021) used GPS trajectory data of e-scooter trips in Austin, Texas for an integration analysis of three types of urban infrastructure: pedestrian walkways, bike lanes and roadways. Their spatio-temporal analysis showed that the travel patterns (e.g., distance and speed) of e-scooter users varied significantly across different urban spaces and different time spans (e.g., hours of day, days of week). Such research findings may improve integration of emerging transport modes with existing infrastructure at both operational and tactical levels.

Studies related to the substitution/complement effect of alternative (traditional) travel modes were also interested in the extent to which the sharing economy may substitute or complement traditional modes. Using GPS data, some studies found that ride-hailing services tend to reduce taxi usage. For example, Nie (2017) used multiyear GPS trajectory data (2013-2015) for the taxi fleet in Shenzhen to investigate the impact of several TNCs (Didi, Kuaidi and Uber) in terms of their early penetration in the market. The author found that TNCs caused a significant short-term reduction in taxi ridership. Elsewhere, Jiang and Zhang (2018) used GPS data from taxis to examine the effect of TNCs on taxi trips in Beijing. They observed a severe drop in taxi pick-ups as TNCs entered the Chinese market.

Beyond ride-hailing services, shared micro-mobility (bikes and e-scooters) also exhibits a potential substitution/complement effect. For example, Luo et al. (2021) used the GPS data from two shared e-scooter providers (Bird and Lime) in Indianapolis, USA to investigate whether the e-scooter service competed with buses. Their findings indicate that shared e-scooters are likely to replace walking or bus trips, especially in downtown areas. Lazarus et al. (2020) used GPS data from a docked bike-sharing provider (Ford GoBike) and a dockless e-bike-sharing provider (JUMP Bikes) in San Francisco to study whether these two systems compete with or complement each other. They found that usage of the two services differed in terms of trip distance and duration, destination and level of spatial concentration (or dispersion), suggesting a complementary relationship, informing the operation and planning of the two modes.

### 4.2 Smart Card Data

Smart cards provide rich information on people's use of public transport, leading to their extensive employment in travel behaviour research across various dimensions and in terms of different spatial-temporal granularities. This research can be divided into three distinct strands.

The first stream of research encompasses earlier studies focused on data enrichment and travel behavioural inference. In many cases, smart card data omit information that is not necessary for operational purposes, most notably certain trip-making characteristics, such as boarding or alighting location, transfer details and trip purpose (Munizaga and Palma, 2012; Pelletier et al., 2011). To manage these limitations, numerous scholars have developed rule-based algorithms to supplement the missing information. This has seen a major body of research focusing on inferring boarding or alighting stops (e.g., Barry et al., 2002) or applying complementary data, such as General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) and in-vehicle GPS data (Nassir et al., 2011). Drawing on enriched data, a passenger flow and origin-destination (OD) matrix is constructed and validated against conventional data, which serves as a basis for further investigations (Munizaga and Palma, 2012). Other researchers have developed methods for inferring more nuanced characteristics regarding activity-travel patterns, including trip purpose, activity location and transfer behaviour (Devillaine et al., 2012; Hofmann and O'Mahony, 2005). Although not directly linked to smart cities, those contributions represent the foundations for unlocking the potential of smart card data and enabling more in-depth research.

The second research strand comprises ongoing studies that utilise smart card data to explore and understand the multidimensional variability of travel behaviour and its influencing factors. In this domain, a main focus is geo-visualisation of travel patterns to produce intuitive insights into public transport travel behaviour. Representative works have mapped aggregated passenger flow volume at station and route levels (e.g., Song et al., 2018) and segmented transit riders into identifiable groups based on their service usage characteristics (Kieu et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2013). This is considered informative for the marketing strategies of transit services.

Elsewhere, recent research has probed the travel behaviour dynamics of transit passengers via data-mining and simulation approaches, providing the basis for short-term ridership predictions. Some such works attend carefully to dimensions including: near real-time boarding and alighting behaviours (Ingvardson et al., 2018); diurnal passenger flow between transit stations (Cheng et al., 2021); between-mode transfer behaviour (Ma et al., 2018); and day-to-day interpersonal and intrapersonal transit usage variability (Egu and Bonnel, 2020). Scholars have also employed sophisticated modelling approaches (e.g., time-series models, machine learning) to investigate the relationship between transit usage/ridership and other natural (e.g., weather) and built-environment factors (Chen et al., 2019; Tao et al., 2018; Wei, 2022). Collectively, these findings have implications for the establishment of a more responsive transit service operating system, which demands devising tactical policy and smart operations to better promote transit usage.

The last research strand encompasses emerging studies that seek to disentangle the socio-spatial impacts of everyday mobility among transit passengers. The derived implications are not confined to the transport context, instead extending to urban planning, public policy and governance. One key topic in this area relates to assessing urban spatial structure (e.g., mono- or polycentric), especially in relation to job-housing relationships - which is important for both short- and long-term land use and transport planning strategies. By examining commuting efficiency across urban space, scholars have been able to identify the areas and population groups affected by imbalanced job and housing distribution (Long and Thill, 2015; Zhao and Cao, 2020) and their dynamics over time in relation to urban development (Huang et al., 2018).

Another group of scholars has focused on revealing unexpected encounters among transit passengers - commonly known as the familiar-stranger phenomenon (Qian et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2018) - which has two main implications. First, the possible psychological, social and economic meanings attributed to co-presence among passengers in public transport contexts may serve as a prerequisite for forming social networks and making contacts. In turn, this may have beneficial outcomes, such as the accumulation of social capital, the sharing of knowledge and community building (Van den Berg et al., 2014). Second, the spatial-temporal dynamics of passenger encounters have important implications for public health, particularly in terms of tracking and monitoring the spread of epidemics (Qian et al., 2021), which can inform the smart governance of cities under emergency conditions (e.g., COVID-19).

### 4.3 Mobile Phone Data

The increasing penetration of mobile phones, especially smartphones, has promoted the growing ubiquity of location-sensing technologies and location-based services that continuously track the geo-locations of users and produce massive amounts of mobile phone data (Calabrese et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2021). Different types of mobile phone data have distinct features and advantages that enable scholars from various fields to explore human mobility dynamics and fuel the realisation of smart cities (Huang et al., 2021). However, mobile phone data are also characterised by certain intrinsic drawbacks, such as privacy issues. Accordingly, earlier research based on mobile phone data mainly engaged in preliminary exercises, such as pre-processing data, extracting travel patterns and addressing other data limitations (Wang et al., 2018). As such, their primary purpose was to verify the reliability of mobile phone data for studying daily mobility (Liu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).

In recent years, two main strands of research have further advanced travel behaviour studies based on mobile phone data. One strand has sought to improve approaches to addressing the challenges of applying mobile phone data (privacy, information accuracy, modelling), and includes a sustained key focus on meeting data protection and privacy regulations. For example, Anda et al. (2021) proposed a method based on modified Markov models and adapted the rejection sampling algorithm to generate agents with similar daily schedules and locations and synthesise real individual mobility. Elsewhere, Ogulenko et al. (2021) investigated a probabilistic Bayesian method for location inference that can offer lower certainty of device locating, helping to solve the privacy-related challenge of mobile phone data applications.

Some studies explore extracting and inferring more reliable and detailed human mobility information (Forghani et al., 2020). For instance, Xu et al. (2020) considered the veracity issue of data-driven mobility research, and developed a two-stage clustering algorithm that can perform better in terms of estimations of indicators for human mobility patterns based on mobile signalling data. Li et al. (2019) focused on the low-frequency problem of mobile phone data, developing a multi-criteria data-partitioning technique to reconstruct continuous human movement trajectories by addressing the missing records of individual movement. Building on these fundamental works, some scholars utilised mobile phone data for mobility simulation purposes. For example, Paipuri et al. (2020) investigated the incorporation of such data into the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram model - an urban traffic management tool usually based on loop detector data and floating car data (FCD) - and achieved more accurate estimations of regional trip lengths and path flow distribution. Bwambale et al. (2019) combined mobile phone data with econometric models of travel demand by applying a hybrid trip generation model framework. Their results showed that the hybrid model based on mobile phone data performed similarly to the traditional model based on household survey data, demonstrating the applicability of mobile phone data in econometric models of transport planning.

The second research strand has further explored the utility of mobile phone data for understanding more cutting-edge mobility-related issues. A prominent research topic in recent years concerns pandemic-related mobility issues (García-Albertos et al., 2019). For example, Grantz et al. (2020) used mobile phone data to examine the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions and explore the drivers behind the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, Oliver et al. (2020) monitored human mobility and physical co-presence to support public health actions across different phases of the pandemic. Elsewhere, several studies have focused on the impacts of COVID-19 on human mobility patterns using mobile phone data (e.g., Molloy et al., 2021; Pan and He, 2022), revealing marked socio-spatial disparity in terms of mobility loss in relation to the pandemic. Meanwhile, some scholars utilised mobile phone data to reveal issues related to social inequality. For example, Moro et al. (2021) explored the association between individual mobility patterns and income segregation; Leite Rodrigues et al. (2021) analysed the daily movement behaviour of favela residents in Brazil to measure their mobility inequalities; and Zhao et al. (2020) identified long commutes in Beijing and assessed their demographic variation, demonstrating the existence of transport inequity.

### 4.4 Geotagged Social Media Data and Volunteer Geographic Information

Social media has become a necessity of daily life for most people, with popular platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, Weibo, Yelp, etc.) allowing people to easily gain and share information about various facilities and opportunities. As such, the data generated by such platforms provide opportunities for understanding how people engage in daily activities and how they perceive their surroundings (Goodchild, 2007; Liu et al., 2016; Galesic et al., 2021). In particular, the data generated by social media platforms often include real-time geospatial tags - user opinions and experiences in diverse geographic contexts. This plethora of information is valuable for sensing various urban systems and identifying urban problems from a user perspective. As such, this has helped establish a new urban analytics paradigm that combines social sensing, urban planning and geography theory (Batty, 2019) to inform smart city practices (Yuan et al., 2020).

Geotagged social media data provide rich dynamic check-in information that enables the identification of user mobility across different temporal scales. Applying social media in the context of travel behaviour research can be observed in the context of travel behaviour modelling (Liao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2017) and activity pattern analysis (Hasan and Ukkusari, 2014; Maghrebi et al., 2015; Zhao and Zhang, 2017). For example, Liao et al. examined the feasibility and generalisability of geotagged Twitter data for travel demand estimation. Their results suggest that social media data can be used to model overall travel demand on a typical weekday, but not for specific trip purpose. Hasan and Ukkusari (2014) proposed a probabilistic topic model to classify weekly activity patterns based on Twitter data, and extended the model to predict missing activities, a major challenge for social media data. Building on the time geography theory, Zhao and Zhang (2017) presented a Markov-based methodology framework to estimate dynamic individual activity chains over a 24-hour period by utilising check-ins from Foursquare and Twitter. Elsewhere, Maghrebi et al. (2015) applied text-mining techniques to the content of tweets to extract activity patterns across seven regions of the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia.

From a strategic perspective, a growing body of literature has examined how social media could contribute to smart governance by facilitating communication between governments and citizens. Citizen suggestions for, participation in and feedback about government processes are critical to the success of smart cities. Accordingly, some scholars have attempted to explore how transport officials can use social media to gauge public opinion and interact with citizens. In a comprehensive review, Pender et al. (2014) revisited the literature on the role of social media in managing unplanned transit network disruptions, considering network type, service frequency, location and length/type of disruption. They concluded that social media use remains in its infancy as a communication tool and features certain limitations, including unreliability and the need for significant staffing resources, but the utilisation of a crowdsourcing approach could be a potential solution to these challenges. Researchers have also empirically explored how social media data can contribute to incident detection and management (Stambaugh, 2013; Chan and Schofer, 2014).

Social media studies have also gained popularity in service operation and evaluation research in the context of gauging and monitoring public opinion and user experiences and emotions during travel. For smart mobility, understanding public attitudes towards transport systems is critical to initiating related policies and investment decisions (Yuan et al., 2020; Luo and He, 2021b). Current research is mostly still at the exploratory stage in terms of understanding the whereabouts of incidents/people and the main topics of concern to passengers (Schweitzer, 2014). For example, Collins et al. (2013) analysed real-time transit rider satisfaction in Chicago in relation to performance factors such as punctuality, cleanliness and safety. In addition, Shin (2023) extracted online reviews on Yelp of Los Angeles Metro rail stations to analyse user evaluations. Contrary to previous research, the reviews included more compliments than complaints, which the authors attributed to differences in user perceptions and socioeconomic status between rail and bus users. Finally, Luo and He (2021a) investigated user perceptions of transit services by analysing the spatial and temporal dynamics in the Chinese context using Weibo data. Their findings have implications for the management of transit services over both the short and long term.

### 4.5 Other Types of Data Relating to Smart Cities

In addition to the main new and emerging data that have attracted attention from travel behaviour researchers, some less explored data may warrant further consideration. These data types and their sources will become more relevant to daily mobility in the era of smart cities. Examples here include: sensors mounted on smart lampposts to capture traffic flow and volume; mobile scanners (e.g., drones and Google Street View) to collect and predict traffic volume and the built environment; laser sensors to provide light detection and ranging (LiDAR) information detecting urban spatial structures and vehicle speed; sensors installed on the ground for smart parking applications to capture or impute destination choice and activity duration; and WiFi hotspots to provide visitor head-counts.

This section presents the example of charging data for electric vehicles (EVs), which will become increasingly valuable with more electrification of mechanised mobility. EV charging infrastructure is considered a lever for boosting smart mobility and sustainability-for example, by reducing carbon emissions and encouraging the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy (Siemens, 2021). As EVs become more common in cities, charging behaviour will be inextricably linked to travel behaviour because charging behaviour implies vehicle miles (kilometres) travelled, destination choice and even route choice. This makes such data valuable for understanding driver charging behaviour and associated travel behaviour, which has the potential to provide input, especially for the spatial opti-misation of charging facilities (He et al., 2016; He et al., 2022b).

Using a sample dataset provided by Hong Kong EV Power Limited, one of the city's leading charging infrastructure service providers, we analysed the use frequency and duration for different types of charger. Figure 11.2 reveals that EV users have very different usage patterns for public and private chargers. Regarding charging frequency by day of the week, public chargers are used more frequently on Sunday and Monday, while private chargers are used substantially more often on Monday. Over a 24-hour period, public charger usage is concentrated across working hours ( $8 : {00}$ am to $7 : {00}\mathrm{{pm}}$ ),with private chargers mainly used during the afternoon and evening (3:00 to ${10} : {00}\mathrm{\;{pm}}$ ). This suggests that EV users tend to use public chargers throughout the day to align with their own travel and various types of out-of-home activities. The usage of private chargers in later hours of the day suggests that EV users tend to use private chargers in or near their residential premises. Furthermore, public chargers demonstrate very stable charging times during the week, while private chargers take slightly longer on Fridays. The difference in charging time between public and private chargers also implies the presence of various constraints for public charger users, such as scheduling, parking and car park opening hours. However, despite the valuable insights gained from charging data, this information is not yet widely available. Nevertheless, as more data providers become willing to share their data, researchers can more easily explore the travel behaviour of EV users, who will eventually represent the majority of car users.

### 4.6 Summary of New and Emerging Data in Travel Behaviour Research

To summarise, we have witnessed a large influx of new and emerging data that are suitable for travel behaviour research. As discussed above, researchers in the field have presented

Figure 11.2 Charging behaviour of EV users in Hong Kong various empirical studies to show the potential of these data in advancing our understanding of human mobility. Indeed, the aforementioned five categories of data can provide supplementary information for and solutions to conventional data (Table 11.2). These include (but are not limited to): a wide variety of data for more detailed analysis of both conventional and new forms of mobility; realised capability of near real-time monitoring and adjustment of transport system; and progress towards more evidence-based transport planning. Nonetheless, these new and emerging types of data are no panacea to known data issues. There are also critical limitations of big data application. The next section will present a more in-depth discussion of the challenges and opportunities.

## 5 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA IN SMART CITIES

### 5.1 Challenges

While smart city projects provide large and varied amounts of information, there remain certain concerns and critiques about the quality and validity of big data, which produces challenges in terms of using big-data analytics to better understand human mobility and make more informed decisions regarding smart cities.

First, compared to conventional travel survey data, the geospatial information provided by big data tends to be richer and correspond to a more refined spatial scale. However, big data (including from smart cards and mobile phones) must still address the 'data-rich but information poor' issue (Wang et al., 2018, p. 151). While big data contain huge quantities of mobility information, they often lack other information that is also important to travel behaviour research, such as socio-demographic characteristics. As noted, algorithms have been developed to infer certain attributes for big data, such as trip purpose (Tao et al., 2021). However, relying solely on big data usually results in pattern detection, precluding insights into the underlying mechanisms of travel behaviour. Hence, data fusion remains necessary to further complement big data by providing relevant attributes - such as personal characteristics, multimodal use and built environment (e.g., land use) - and enabling more comprehensive investigation of human mobility (Wang et al., 2018).

Second, many studies utilising big data face problems of geospatial accuracy and privacy. While the geospatial information provided by location-based big data (especially GPS and mobile phone data) can be quite refined, such detailed information may make it possible to track the activities and locations of specific individuals. This potential hazard may require preventive measures, such as aggregating individual data or intentionally applying geo-masking (Oksanen et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). This may sacrifice geo-spatial accuracy to some degree, which might influence the implications of the mobility patterns captured, especially for micro-level mobility models (but not necessarily for macro-scale models). Better reconciliation of the conflict between geo-information accuracy and privacy protection represents another challenge for future big-data researchers that can inform smart city practices and decision-making.

Third, some big data used in travel behaviour research (especially from mobile phones and social media) may not represent society as a whole. Because digital technology does

not cover every social stratum, there is a digital divide between those who have access to ICT (and smartphones) and those who do not (Riggins and Dewan, 2005). This means that the dataset analysed merely represents the users who generate the data. For example, lower-income groups may lack access to smartphones or may avoid using mobile data, and older people may be less likely to use e-scooters. As such, lack of consideration of the digital divide issue may produce biased results and inequitable implications, meaning the issue of capturing the less-digital cohorts in big-data analytics remains to be addressed.

Fourth, an increasing challenge concerns how big-data analytics may contribute to the theoretical development of human mobility and strategic implications for smart cities. As previously noted, most existing research has employed big data to identify near real-time mobility patterns, rarely explaining their underpinning mechanisms and causal relationships (Batty, 2013). Addressing causal questions will be beneficial to long-term strategic decisions in terms of planning for smart cities (Tao et al., 2021). Although most big data can be analysed to facilitate the real-time or short-term operation of transport systems, given their continuous storage of mobility information, certain data types (e.g., mobile phone and smart card data) may be more suitable for studying long-term travel behaviour patterns, thereby supporting long-term planning. However, addressing this issue poses several epistemological challenges for big-data analytics - most notably the need to establish more theory-oriented research paradigms and develop new hypotheses about human mobility, which largely remain lacking (Kandt and Batty, 2021).

There are also data-specific challenges, particularly in terms of data processing and mining. For example, GPS data presents challenges concerning better correcting uncertain or erroneous locations and identifying ways of complementing travel information within a vertical environment. For several data types (e.g., GPS, smart card and mobile phone), there is still a need to better extract and validate travel behaviour characteristics (e.g., transport mode, trip purpose) by developing and/or applying more sophisticated algorithms (Chen et al., 2016; Dabiri and Heaslip, 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Regarding social media data, effectively removing noise in the data remains a key challenge that requires the development of more sophisticated information recognition and cleaning algorithms (Imran et al., 2015). Addressing these big-data shortcomings via methodological advancement will also benefit smart city practices by providing more reliable evidence.

### 5.2 Opportunities

Given the challenges detailed, there are emerging opportunities to further unlock the potential of big data to better understand travel behaviour and inform smart city practice and theories.

First, as noted, novel data collection and fusion methods can be developed to enrich mobility-focused big data (e.g., mobile phone and smart card data) with other important information (e.g., socio-demographic attributes, land use features). This should preferably be at the individual level to allow more in-depth analysis of travel behaviour at both the disaggregate and the aggregate level (Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). However, it remains critical to address the need to protect privacy by testing and applying new preventive measures to avoid disclosing sensitive personal and activity information (Cheng et al., 2021).

Second, future research should seek to explicitly test and validate the results from analysing big data, especially regarding the two critical questions: (1) whether big data can comprehensively capture travel behaviour (e.g., trips for different purposes and trip chaining); and (2) whether big data might overlook certain populations (e.g., less-digital groups). Although some previous research has examined the validity of big data at the group or spatially aggregated level (Long and Thill, 2015; Munizaga and Palma, 2012), this approach might overlook certain spatial and interpersonal differences in travel behaviour. Chen et al. (2014) developed a method to simulate and test a mobile phone dataset from a household travel survey via ground truthing at the individual level. However, similar research remains limited.

Third, big data can be used to investigate atypical travel behaviour (Wang et al., 2018), and could focus on one of two perspectives: (1) behavioural change under less expected conditions, such as extreme weather conditions, social unrest and natural disasters; (2) irregular or less normal travel behaviour, such as cross-regional/overly long commutes or non-commute travel. The former pertains closely to improving the resilience of intelligent transport systems; and the latter may help enhance our understanding of social-spatial outcomes of daily transport, such as social inequality and segregation. Novel metrics that better capture intra- and interpersonal variability can be developed to better respond to these issues (Egu and Bonnel, 2020; Wei, 2022). Furthermore, compared to the global north, research drawing on big data has been relatively limited in less-developed contexts (such as Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa), where the issues of transport poverty and disadvantage are expected to be more pronounced. More research focused on these regions can contribute to the smart governance of cities in different contexts.

Another opportunity for smart cities concerns the IoT (Sun et al., 2016) as the urban environments will include networks of sensors and communicative 'things'. If location-based devices (smartphones, GPS trackers) can be designed to communicate with networks, then the geographical scale of the information from tracked objects (whether humans or vehicles) can become more accurate or refined. Furthermore, connecting various devices and smart applications via the IoT may enable perceived experience to be tracked throughout an individual's daily travel and activities, which to date has only been attempted in limited ways (Tu et al., 2017). Addressing this issue will create opportunities to capture and understand people's mobility decisions and experiences at whole new levels of comprehensiveness and depth. This requires more methodological works to better integrate big data from different sources and develop frameworks for the synthetic analysis of big data.

Finally, efforts should be made to further explore big data's usefulness for theoretical development and the reframing of strategies and policies related to smart cities. As noted, this requires a shift away from data-driven approaches and towards theoretical research. This might involve (but is not limited to): analysing small data (household travel surveys) to explore and generate new hypotheses; testing hypotheses by analysing big data and the links between influential factors; and interpreting and theorising analytical outcomes (Kandt and Batty, 2021). Furthermore, to form a feedback loop around theoretical development and policymaking, research should examine the impact of smart city policies and whether they are likely to generate the anticipated effects. In this regard, particular attention should be afforded to policies that relate to ongoing environmental and societal trends (e.g., climate change, ageing populations, digitalisation of daily life) that have become increasingly influential in smart city practice.

## 6 CONCLUSION

In the era of smart cities, ICT and connected networks are rapidly evolving, and their advancement and penetration in smart cities offer new and emerging mobility options that will be (or have been) integrated with traditional transport systems, changing how people move around cities and perform various activities.

This chapter has explored the connection between travel behaviour data and the development of smart cities. It delved into the latest applications of various types of new and emerging data, such as GPS and trajectory tracking, smart cards, mobile phones, social media, and EV chargers, along with the associated analytics in the context of travel behaviour research. The advantages of these data types align with those of big data; however, they also come with some drawbacks. We have recognised the many limitations of the new and emerging data types that are common in smart cities. However, despite challenges, there are many known advantages of these data types in travel behaviour research. Although conventional surveys can probe travel behaviour, the new and emerging data types available in the era of smart cities enable the detection of more nuanced and emergent travel patterns and trends. As such, they offer unprecedented opportunities for transport researchers to enter a new phase of exploration and adventure capable of illuminating transport planning and smart city practices.
