Disruptions to transport systems often significantly change travel behaviour. This is especially true when the disruption lasts over an extended period and is accompanied by the massive-scale dysfunction of transit operations. In addition, although attitude is critical for predicting travel behaviour, there is little documentation of changes in attitudes towards transit modes and the factors influencing such changes during a transit system disruption. Furthermore, few studies have investigated how social movements can exert a pronounced disrupting effect on a transit system. To fill these research gaps and provide policy recommendations for a more responsive contingency plan in response to future transit system disruptions, our study aims to investigate this issue based on the case of Hong Kong during the 2019 social movement. We collected a questionnaire survey representing the period from late June to early July 2020, a few months after the end of the protests. Using structural equation models, we have examined how people's attitudes towards different transit modes changed during the social movement. Our findings highlight that people's perception of the city's urban rail system - the Mass Transit Railway, which the government has a significant stake in and control over - worsened significantly during the transit disruption, but the effects were less pronounced for bus and mini-bus. In addition, attitudes towards the social movement were found to vary significantly across social groups, a finding linked to people's attitudes towards different transit modes. Importantly, our study reveals that people's views of social movements can significantly determine how they evaluate impacted and alternative transport modes during transit disruptions. These newly revealed attitudinal dimensions should be fully considered in predicting behavioural change and adjusting transit services under similar conditions.

## 1. Introduction

The provision of transit services plays a critical role in maintaining urban mobility and the normal functioning of the various interdependent components of a city. Many transit operators around the world aim to improve the performance level of their service in terms of reliability, punctuality and safety. However, even in the most developed regions, interruptions to public transit systems are not unusual for various reasons. Some of the most common causes for transit disruption include technical glitches, accidents and vandalism (Pendleton, 2011; Pnev-matikou et al., 2015). Beyond human-related factors, natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and extreme weather conditions (e.g., typhoons and floods) may also prompt halts or delays of transit services (Hofmann and O'Mahony, 2005; Pregnolato et al., 2017; Zhu and Levinson, 2008).

Incidents and events leading to the disruption of a transit system usually compel people to change their travel behaviour temporarily, that is, for a period of several hours or days (Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2018; Shires et al., 2019). Empirical research has found that in response to transit disruptions, people's behavioural responses range from modal shift (using alternative modes for the same trip) to re-routing and re-scheduling (Currie and Muir, 2017; Papangelis et al., 2016; Pnev-matikou et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017). By and large, transit services are also expected to be delivered or quickly restored from temporary halts. However, the rarely occurring and, hence, less studied situation is when the disruption of the transit system lasts for an extended period. Such a situation may have serious outcomes (e.g., paralysis of the transport system), including for interlinked dimensions of the urban system (Jespersen-Groth et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2013; Shires et al., 201). In this regard, social movements (e.g., public protests and strikes) act as a key interfering factor that can cause the extended disruption of the transit system (Freire Castello, 2020; Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2018). Differing from other types of incidents, social movements are often linked to strong political attitudes (e.g., inclination towards the government or certain events) that potentially affect people's attitudes towards different transit modes. Capturing this interplay has implications for management strategies in response to transit disruptions caused by social movements. However, research on this issue has been scant.

This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating people's attitudes towards different transit modes after an extended period and a massive scale of disruption, adopting the 2019 Hong Kong social movement as a case study. Particular attention has been assigned to the role of people's attitudes towards the social movement. Beginning in June 2019, a series of protests broke out in Hong Kong that were collectively termed the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement (Anti-ELAB movement). ${}^{1}$ As tensions heightened between the public and the local government (particularly law enforcement departments), there was also an escalation of violent acts, including vandalism of the public transit network and the overall transport system (IPCC, 2020). The vandalism and the consequent damage most severely impacted the city's rail network, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) network. Vandalism acts such as arson and window-breaking eventually resulting in the frequent system-wide disruption of the MTR service between October and early December of 2019.

According to the Legislative Council Panel on Transport Subcommittee on Matters Relating to Railways (2019), 85 out of 93 rail stations had experienced physical damage as of 24 November 2019. There were 1951 accumulated damage counts of ticket gates, 1146 of ticket machines, 1278 of CCTV cameras, 79 of lifts, 123 of escalators, 1158 of glass panels at station exits and 191 of station exit roller shutters. These incidents resulted in the early closure of MTR services and, in the worst cases, partial or full disruption of the MTR and other transit (especially bus) networks. Such vandalism acts were largely pacified by the pandemic outbreak in 2020. In addition to the MTR network, vandalism acts extended to road traffic, leading to the obstruction of certain major road segments. Compared to previous accounts of social movements (e. g., strikes) in the literature, the case of Hong Kong corresponded to a much longer period and a higher level of severity, thus providing a unique research opportunity.

Drawing on information from various sources (e.g., the Transport Department, media coverage and social media), MTR stations were categorised based on the number of days of disruption during the social movement (also see Fig. 2), data derived from the Natural Jenks Breaks. It appears that stations with more disruption days (i.e., over 13 days) were concentrated in the urban areas of Kowloon and, to a lesser extent, Hong Kong Island (HKI). However, certain MTR stations in the New Territories (NT; new towns in particular) also experienced considerable disruptions. Fig. 1 depicts the occurrence of different types of disruption across the MTR network between early June and late December, the rough period of the social movement. The main peaks of MTR disruption happened in early and late August and between October and November. In August, "Line shutdown" and "Station bypassed" were the prevalent types of service disruption. The only event of "Network shutdown" occurred in early October for two consecutive days after widespread vandalism during the National Day holidays. Subsequently, "Line shutdown", "Station closed" and "Station bypassed" were invoked as precautions against (further) damages and became more pronounced during another wave of protests in November 2019.

This study seeks to address the identified knowledge gaps by investigating the travel attitudes of transit travellers during an extended period of disruption. Drawing on social psychology and behavioural theories, a growing body of research suggests that people's daily trip-making decisions (e.g., modal choice) were at least partly influenced by or conditioned on their transport attitudes (particular attitudes towards transport modes) (He and Th√∏gersen, 2017; Spears et al., 2013; Rahman and Sciara, 2022). In general, favourable attitudes towards a given mode may increase the likelihood of using the mode. However, few studies have investigated how people may change travel attitudes during transit disruptions (e.g., whether they perceive transit service as less reliable or safe), although such changes are often associated with short- or longer-term fluctuation of service quality. The political protests and upheavals in Hong Kong saw an escalation of violent acts that resulted in extensive unplanned disruptions and even paralysis of the MTR service and certain road segments across the city. The scale and severity of transit disruptions was particularly detrimental for this highly transit-oriented city. Meanwhile, individuals likely maintained diverse opinions about the social movement and the associated vandalism.

Drawing on a questionnaire survey conducted from late June to early July 2020, a few months after the end of the social movement, this study investigated how the social movement and related vandalism might have impacted people's attitudes towards public transit services. The insights obtained should enable both Hong Kong and other cities to devise better contingency plans and transport policies to respond to similar situations. The rest of this study is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 presents the theoretical framework underpinning the current study. Section 4 describes the study context and the survey and analytical methods. Section 5 details the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 summarises and discusses the main findings before Section 7 draws a series of tentative conclusions.

## 2. Literature review

### 2.1. Transit service disruption and travel behavioural change

Transport scholars have identified three main categories of transit service disruption: planned-pre-announced, planned-unannounced and unplanned-unannounced (Zhu and Levinson, 2008; van Exel and Rietveld, 2009). Upgrades or maintenance works of transit infrastructure and special events (e.g., the Olympic games) belong to the first category. Under such circumstances, transit users will normally be advised about the disruption of transit services, giving them relatively sufficient time to make adjustments (Zhu and Levinson, 2008). In terms of the second category, deliberately disrupting transit services without any pre-warning or announcement represents a rare situation where the mobility and benefits of transit users may not be considered (or even compromised intentionally), such as the infamous Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack (Pendleton, 2011). Finally, the unplanned-unannounced disruption normally involves the sudden collapse or technical failure of transport infrastructure. Empirical research in this area appears to mainly focus on road traffic, such as the collapse of bridges in Minneapolis (the United States) and Hobart (Australia) (Zhu and Levinson, 2008). Apart from human-related factors, natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and extreme weather conditions can also present critical challenges to transit systems, resulting in significant service disruption (Chang and Nojima, 2001; Hofmann and O'Mahony, 2005).

When faced with transit service disruptions, many transit riders alter their travel behaviour to conduct certain daily activities. A growing body of research has shed light on this issue through both revealed-preference (RP) and stated-preference (SP) approaches focused on past events of transit disruption or hypothetical disruption scenarios (Adel√© et al., 2019; Nazem et al., 2018). Most existing research has examined the immediate behavioural response. For example, Zhu and Levinson (2011) reviewed the relevant literature and highlighted three main dimensions of public transport users' responses: mode shifts, route choice and departure time. While some studies captured all three dimensions of behavioural change (e.g., Currie and Muir, 2017), others investigated a single dimension (e.g., Rahimi et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2017). In most cases, participants were asked to indicate their choice of alternative transport options or travel plans (e.g., departure time or route) under the various circumstances of transit disruption (e.g., temporary halt of transit service or longer-term service disruption due to infrastructure renovation), with researchers commonly adopting discrete choice theory or related methods (e.g., the random regret minimisation principle) (Lin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018).

Scholars have also probed behavioural change under transit disruptions of different scales and severity. For example, in less serious situations (e.g., a temporary halt of transit services), minor adaptations such as changing travel time and waiting for service restoration were more common (Auld et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). In Toronto, Lin et al. (2018) conducted a small-scale study featuring 96 participants and observed that shuttle buses served as an important alternative mode during disruptions to the local subway service, with some others choosing to walk even for relatively longer trips. Some studies have also examined the impact of more persistent situations on long-term travel behaviour, producing mixed results. For example, crime- and terrorism-related incidents were shown to spread fear among passengers and imprint negative perceptions on them, discouraging future use (Lin et al., 2018). Examining the impacts of station renovation, Nazem et al. (2018) confirmed a persistent ridership reduction even when the disruption was limited to a single station.

Some researchers have also investigated the factors that might influence people's behavioural changes in response to transit disruptions. In particular, divergent systematic responses of different demographic groups have been detected. For example, younger people have been observed to be more reluctant to resort to alternative modes during temporary transit disruptions (van Exel and Rietveld, 2009), and women have been recorded as less willing to wait for resumptions of train service and more ready to choose alternative transit modes (Wang et al., 2018). Behavioural differences are also conditional on travellers' socio-economic status (Pnevmatikou et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Specifically, better-off groups might choose to drive or use taxis (or dial-and-ride services such as Uber), with lower-income groups mostly restricted to buses or walking as alternative options (Zhu et al., 2017). In addition, trip characteristics, such as purpose and distance might induce heterogeneous responses. For example, people tend to actively change their travel plan to make sure that mandatory trips (e.g., commuting trips) can be conducted (Auld et al., 2020; van Exel and Rietveld, 2009). Shorter or medium-distance trips are less likely to be rearranged, and long-distance trips are more likely to be substituted by private cars (Nguyen-Phuoc et al., 2018; Rahimi et al., 2019; van Exel and Rietveld, 2009).

Despite the accumulating research, knowledge gaps concerning the attitudinal dimension of travel behaviour in the context of transit disruptions remain. It has been increasingly acknowledged among transport scholars that beyond socio-demographic and built environment characteristics, attitude serves as a key influencer of travel behaviour (e. g., how people perceive a given transport mode) (Anable, 2005; Chen and Lai, 2011; Spears et al., 2013; Van Acker et al., 2010). Drawing on socio-psychological theories (e.g., the theory of planned behaviour), researchers have found that the variability of daily travel behaviour (e. g., the use of different transport modes) can be partially explained by the attitudes of individuals (Lee et al., 2020; Prillwitz and Barr, 2011), which are also influenced by their past usage of a given mode (Tao et al., 2017). Favourable attitudes towards a given transport mode stemming from previous experience have been linked to a higher likelihood of continuing to use that mode (Spears et al., 2013). Hence, both the prediction and effective intervention of travel demand require a more in-depth understanding of how people may perceive different transport modes under both regular and irregular conditions (Bamberg et al., 2011). However, it remains largely unclear how people's attitudes towards different transport modes vary under transit disruptions - a key type of irregular situation. This deficit in understanding may limit our ability to devise effective policy measures for coping with less expected behavioural changes.

### 2.2. Social movements and transit service disruptions: the role of political attitudes

Social movements as a particular type of human factor may also induce significant disruptions to transit networks. Compared to other types of disruption, social movements are often imbued with strong political motives and can be of a radical nature. A typical example of a social movement is a strike, which involves deliberately halting work to voice the rights and demands of a given sector (e.g., public transport workers) to improve conditions via a settlement. Empirical research has demonstrated that amid transit strikes and network-wide disruptions, switches in mode from public transit are inevitable, with private vehicles often the most chosen alternative. For example, in Melbourne, Nguyen-Phuoc et al. (2018) found that the halt of train services due to strikes prompted up to ${43}\%$ of train users to shift to cars,a response that can cause significant traffic congestion and worsen travel experience. A smaller yet significant modal shift to cars is also expected to occur when bus and tram services are withdrawn. In the Dutch context, van Exel and Rietveld (2009) found that after a national rail strike, over 40% of rail users cancelled their trips, with another 24% of users switching to cars. In addition, Zhu and Levinson (2011) observed an undermined reliability perception of public transit caused by strike and expected long-term effects on transit ridership.

Apart from protest, public transport is often conducive to the impact of other types of social movements, such as protest. In a recent study, Freire Castello (2020) reported that social protests in Santiago, Chile, throughout October 2020 involved the large-scale wrecking of metro stations. Certain vandalism acts (e.g., defacement, graffiti at transit stations) may be considered part of social movements, especially when they are intended to give voice to certain social issues or injustices (Thompson et al., 2012). However, the main strategies for addressing vandalism activities appear to revolve around devising preventive measures (e.g., deploying video surveillance) (e.g., Huts et al., 1999). Although there are also concerns about the potential discouraging effect of vandalism on transit usage, transit disruptions have been less associated with such issues. In addition, an explicit link between social movements, transport/mobility demand and transit systems has rarely been made.

Furthermore, the attitudinal dimension of behavioural change in response to social-movement-induced transit disruptions and the factors influencing it remains largely under-studied. Omitting this dimension may lead to less reliable prediction of behavioural changes and, consequently, futile interventions. To understand this issue, we argue that in addition to past behaviour, the role of political attitudes (e.g., the perceptions of government, policies and related events) also deserves particular attention, given that public transport is essentially a public service, even when privatised or semi-privatised. The public administration literature has argued and evidenced that satisfaction with public services is significantly contingent on people's attitudes towards the government, with the public administration constantly considered an extension of the body of government (Kampen et al., 2006). Some researchers have also found that ethical consideration of politics (e.g., inclination towards supporting certain policies) significantly influences people's attitudes towards the government's administrative acts (Vig-oda-Gadot, 2007). Given these findings, we contend that in a politicised situation (such as a social movement), people's attitudes towards public transit can be affected by both their political attitudes towards the situation and their past usage of transit. This, in turn, affects their trip-making decisions. Taken together, it appears plausible that when public transport performance is related to a social movement, perceived service quality will be influenced by people's attitudes towards the social movement. However, empirical research on this issue remains limited. Hence, this research seeks to address several pertinent questions: How do people perceive different transit modes in the context of transit disruptions caused by a social movement? How do attitudes towards the social movement affect people's attitudes towards different transit modes during transit disruptions?

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Conceptual framework

This study's main target variable is attitudes towards Hong Kong's three main transit modes (i.e., MTR, bus and mini-bus) in the context of transit disruptions caused by the 2019 social movement. Based on the review of the literature, we expect people's attitudes and perceptions of transport modes to be significantly influenced by their political attitudes. The current study specifies political attitudes as attitudes towards the social movement (i.e., agreement or disagreement with the Anti-ELAB movement). Notably, because the local government has a strong relationship and vested interest in the MTR (Cervero and Murakami, 2009; He et al., 2018), the MTR became the target of vandalism during the Anit-ELAB movement. This was less the case for bus and mini-bus services. As such, we expect that attitudes towards the social movement will exert more pronounced effects on the MTR than buses and mini-buses. Based on previous research (e.g., Tao et al., 2019; Th√∏gersen, 2018), we also expect people's past usage of different transit modes to affect their attitudes towards the different transit modes. Another plausible hypothesis is that the effect of past transit behaviour on attitudes and perceptions towards transit modes will be mediated by the attitudes towards the social movement. Finally, we control for the effects of socio-demographic and built environment characteristics. Accordingly, we have developed the theoretical framework presented in Fig. 2 to guide the empirical analysis.

### 3.2. Study context and disruptions to the MTR lines during the 2019 social movement

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region mainly comprises HKI, Kowloon and the NT. HKI is the main urban area that contains the city's main central business districts. Both Kowloon and NT are located in a larger peninsula adjoining the south border of Shenzhen (a major city in China's Guangdong province). Kowloon is also highly urbanised, with the NT mainly comprising new towns and rural areas. The NT covers most of the city's geographical area. Hong Kong's transport system relies heavily on public transit. Two main transit modes, the MTR and (franchised) bus, account for over 50% of all daily mechanised trips (Transport Department, 2014). Some minor transit modes (e.g., minibus, light rail transit, tram, tram and ferry) are responsible for around 28% of all mechanised trips, with other trips taken by private vehicles and taxi. During the outbreak of the social movement between June and December 2019, vandalism acts eventually affected the operation and services across the whole MTR network (see Fig. 3). The affected time of MTR's 93 stations ranged between 4 and 61 days. Stations that experienced the longest disruptions included Kowloon Station, Tsing Yi Station, University Station and Asia World-Expo Station. The MTR stations that experienced a disruption of 15 days or longer were located in HKI $\left( {\mathrm{N} = 4}\right)$ ,Kowloon $\left( {\mathrm{N} = 8}\right)$ and the $\mathrm{{NT}}\left( {\mathrm{N} = 9}\right)$ . These severely affected stations were particularly densely located in Kowloon, where the majority of the large-scale protests took place during the 2019 social movement.

Fig. 4 presents the ridership trend for the MTR between January 2018 and December 2019. In addition to the absolute number, year-to-year percentage change has also been estimated (captured by the red-dot line). Fig. 4 shows that ridership fluctuated moderately from January 2018 to July 2019, with a notable decrease of ridership after June 2019, the month marking the beginning of the 2019 social movement. The most severe decline in ridership was observed in October and November, with year-to-year changes of -25.7% and -25.1%. This almost certainly demonstrates that the abnormal patterns observed in late 2019 were caused by the social movement. Overall, changing MTR ridership basically aligns with the intensity of MTR disruption documented in Fig. 1.

### 3.3. Questionnaire survey

A questionnaire survey was conducted online using a survey company between late June and early July 2020. Considering the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, the online survey was appropriate and the only possible way to conduct a large-scale survey. The general population aged 18 or above were recruited from panel members of the survey company. Quotas on age were assigned to follow the census population characteristics as closely as feasible. Recruitment was conducted by the survey company. The online survey was open for two weeks to fulfil the sampling target. A total of 1204 completed questionnaires were returned. After removing certain cases with missing or inconsistent information, 962 cases were retained for the current study.

The questionnaire featured three main parts. The first part included questions regarding people's past usage of MTR, bus and mini-bus. Respondents were also asked to indicate the average trip durations for commuting and non-commuting trips by each of the three transit modes. Trip duration was recorded using a series of time categories (i.e., not using a specific transport mode, $0 - {15}\mathrm{\;{min}},{15} - {30}\mathrm{\;{min}},{30} - {45}\mathrm{\;{min}}$ , ${45} - {60}\mathrm{\;{min}},1 - {1.5}\mathrm{\;h},{1.5} - 2\mathrm{\;h},2 - {2.5}\mathrm{\;h},{2.5} - 3\mathrm{\;h},3\mathrm{\;h}$ and above). For modelling purposes, we re-coded trip duration using the midpoint of the categories (i.e., 0, 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5, 75, 105, 135, 165, and 180 min). We used ${180}\mathrm{\;{min}}$ for $3\mathrm{\;h}$ and above because very few participants reported such a trip duration.

The second part of the questionnaire probed participants' attitudes towards the three public transport modes before and during the social movement in terms of five dimensions, namely, dependency on the mode, service reliability, perceived security, reaction to emergency crises and faith and loyalty. A 7-point Likert scale was employed, with 1 representing the lowest rating and 7 the highest rating. The information derived from this part allows us to capture how people's attitudes towards public transit may have changed in response to transit disruptions (as detailed in the following section).

The third part measured participants' attitudes towards the Anti-ELAB movement. It again used a 7-point Likert scale, with possible responses ranging from "strongly oppose" (1) to "strongly support" (7). Example questions for the former include: "What is your view of the Anti-ELAB Movement?" and "What is your view on boycotting MTR operations?"

### 3.4. Methods

The current study employed structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM is a family of modelling techniques that allow simultaneous estimation of multiple causal (or, in many cases, associative) relationships. A full SEM model encompasses a measurement model that specifies latent variables (e.g., attitudinal dimensions) based on observed characteristics and a structural model that tests the interrelationships between all endogenous and exogenous variables (for a detailed discussion about SEM, see Byrne, 2001).

In an SEM model, a variance-covariance matrix of the observed variables is constructed as the starting point for estimating regression coefficients between endogenous and exogenous variables based on the specified relationships between them. Thus, model fit is determined based on the estimated and observed variance-covariance matrices of the variables (Golob, 2003). In the current study, we are particularly interested in the following relationships, which will be estimated simultaneously by SEM:

$$
{AT} = {\beta }_{p}{PAST} +  + {\beta }_{as}{AS} + {\beta }_{s}{X}_{s} + {\beta }_{b}{X}_{b} + \varepsilon  \tag{1}
$$

$$
{AS} = {\beta }_{p}{PAST} + {\beta }_{s}{X}_{s} + \mu  \tag{2}
$$

Where ${AT}$ entails the attitudes towards the three main transit modes (MTR, bus and minibus); PAST represents the past usage of different transport modes; ${AS}$ entails attitudes towards the social movement; ${X}_{s}$ and ${X}_{b}$ are the socio-demographic and built environment characteristics; $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are the error terms. We utilised the robust weighted least squares approach, which enables less biased estimation of ordinal outcomes. MPlus 8.3 was employed to perform the SEM analysis.

## 4. Results

### 4.1. Descriptive results

Statistics of the key independent variables and other control variables are summarised in Appendix I. First, we conducted a basic descriptive analysis to compare our respondents' background traits to the census population. In general, our samples closely follow the sex, marital status and housing type split of the adult population in Hong Kong. However, the means of income and education level in our samples are above the average of the census population, while the average age is younger than the census. These disparities are commonly expected for online-recruited samples in similar research contexts (Adel√© et al., 2019; Auld et al., 2020).

An examination of the modal shift behaviours indicates that nearly half of the sample (49%) shifted mode during transit disruptions. One-fifth of the sample (20%) indicated they cancelled related trips, with the rest (31%) choosing not to change their modal use. Among those who shifted modes, bus, mini-bus and active travel (walking and cycling) emerged as the main alternative options. However, many respondents also chose to combine multiple modes, indicating a highly heterogeneous pattern of modal shift. To enable easier analysis and interpretation, we have combined certain modes, specifically, ferry and tram (two modes only available around certain parts of Hong Kong), with taxi and Uber grouped together.

Next, we explored how people's attitudes towards the three transit modes might have changed during transit disruptions. Transit attitudes were measured as subjective ratings of five dimensions of transit modes before and after the transit disruption on the same 7-point Likert scale. Hence, the after rating was subtracted from the before rating to represent the change in attitudes, with a positive score representing improved perception, and vice versa (see Appendix I). At the 95% confidence interval, attitudes towards the MTR were considerably worse (difference scores around -1). A similar yet less pronounced pattern was observed for attitudes towards bus and mini-bus. These were plausible because the MTR was more affected by the social movement than the other two modes. Finally, concerning people's attitudes towards the Anti-ELAB movement in terms of three dimensions (Appendix I), on average,people tended to support the movement (average score >4 ) but were less supportive of boycotting $\left( { < 4}\right)$ and vandalism $\left( { < 3}\right)$ . However,a further examination indicates that the three dimensions were significantly correlated with each other (Pearson correlation >0.65).

### 4.2. Factor analysis of attitudinal variables

Drawing on the difference scores presented in Table 2, factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed to test and validate the measurement of attitudinal latent variables prior to the SEM analysis (Table 1). According to the results, the attitudinal variables are largely valid. The factor loadings for the observed measurements of the attitudinal variables all exceeded 0.7,and Cronbach‚Äôs $\alpha$ for the observed measurements were also over 0.8 .

Based on the factor analysis, factor scores for the three factors were derived based on the regression method. Examining Pearson correlations indicates that attitudes towards MTR were positively yet weakly correlated with attitudes towards bus and mini-bus (Pearson correlation $< {0.1})$ . However,attitudes towards MTR were negatively associated with attitudes towards the Anti-ELAB movement. Attitudes towards bus and mini-bus were more markedly correlated with each other (Pearson correlation around 0.5 ) and positively linked to attitudes towards the social movement.

### 4.3. Modelling results for attitudes towards transit modes

This part of the analysis considers the modelling results presented in Fig. 5. Note that the graphs in the figure represent a subset of the results of the full models, with only the key relationships of interest shown. The full modelling results can be found in Appendix II.

All three models achieved satisfactory model fit, indicating a good approximation of the data. First, we considered the model for MTR

(Fig. 5a). Concerning key variables of interest, attitudes towards the social movement exhibited a strong, negative effect on people's attitudes towards MTR. This suggests that agreement with the social movement significantly diminished people's attitudes towards MTR (i.e., the MTR service became markedly worse), one of the targets of the social movement. In contrast, past behaviour (captured by average commute and non-commute duration by this mode) did not exert significant effects, suggesting that during transit disruptions, past experience played a minor role in influencing changes in people's transport attitudes. The relationship between past use of the MTR and attitudes towards the social movement was also insignificant, meaning that past experience with the MTR did not significantly influence people's stance in the context of the social movement. Note that dimensions pertaining to acts impacting the MTR service (i.e., boycott and vandalism) contributed to the overall perception of the social movement. This may suggest that, amidst the political turmoil, political views were prioritised over transit usage habits.

Turning to the two other transit modes, bus and mini-bus (Fig. 5b and c), significant positive effects were found for the impact of attitudes towards the social movement on the attitudes towards these two modes. That is, support for the social movement was linked to better perceptions of these transit modes in comparison to before the movement (e.g., the service quality of buses and mini-buses did not decrease much compared to before the movement). This implies that while bus and mini-bus were not the main targets of the social movement, as alternatives to the MTR, they were still linked to political views and opinions, which in turn altered their perceived service quality. Again, past transit behaviour was largely insignificant in relation to attitudes towards the transit modes, except for a negative effect of average commute duration on attitudes towards bus. Interestingly, past transit behaviour was found to influence attitudes towards the social movement, with the latter positively related to both average non-commute duration by bus and average commute duration by mini-bus. A possible explanation is that more experience using these transit modes might reflect people's preference towards different transit modes (i.e., preferring bus and mini-bus to the MTR), reinforcing their attitudes towards the social movement and the related vandalism of the MTR system.

A marked distinction was also observed across different social groups in terms of attitudes towards MTR (see Appendix II for details). In particular, women were observed to have significantly poorer attitudes and perceptions of the MTR during the disruption compared to men, reflecting gender differences in the reaction to transit disruptions. Those with a postgraduate degree recorded relatively more positive attitudes towards MTR than the others, and those with a bachelor's or postgraduate degree exhibited stronger support for the social movement. These seemingly contradictory findings imply that people with a higher educational attainment may be more capable of separating their views concerning the social movement and the service quality of the MTR. In addition, participants living in the urban areas (Kowloon and HKI) exhibited more positive attitudes towards MTR than their counterparts in the NT. This may relate to the denser transit network in the urban areas. Some significant results were also detected for attitudes towards bus. Particularly, compared to the unemployed, full-time and part-time employers recorded significantly better perceptions of bus transit. This implies that buses might serve as a favourable commuting mode in Hong Kong. However, those living in public rental housing rated bus considerably lower after the transit disruption, suggesting the worse performance of buses around these estates. This is plausible because public housing residents might be more affected by the disruption due to their household income level and consequently limited transport options. Furthermore, a higher density of pedestrian facilities was positively linked to attitudes towards bus. This indicates that a pedestrian-friendly environment might also render bus a more favourable mode. However, no marked difference across social groups was found concerning attitudes mini-bus.

Distinctive variations were also detected across social groups in terms of attitudes towards the social movement. Specifically, the middle (e.g., those over 30 years old) and old age groups were found to be less supportive of the social movement than the youngest group. However, those employed part-time and residing in public housing (including public rental housing and via the housing ownership scheme) also more frequently demonstrated positive views about the social movement than their counterparts. These results indicate notable generational and socio-economic differences in terms of political views.

## 5. Discussion and policy implications

Various human-related and natural factors (e.g., strikes and extreme weather conditions) can cause temporary yet severe disruption of transit system, compelling riders to alter their travel plans and behaviour (Pnevmatikou et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017). Under such circumstances, re-arranging a city's transport system to ensure that people's travel needs are adequately met remains a key challenge. Capturing and understanding the driving factors of people's modal choices vis-√†-vis transit disruption constitutes a primary step towards addressing this issue. However, the literature has largely neglected the attitudinal dimension in the context of transport disruptions. Furthermore, few studies have considered the impact of political attitudes on people's attitudes towards transit modes in response to social movements and related transit disruptions. To address this deficit, this study has investigated people's attitudes towards transit modes during the disruption of the MTR system in Hong Kong caused by a local yet massive-scale social movement. The following discusses the main findings and policy implications.

Our analysis indicates that during the social movement and associated wide disruption of the MTR, people's attitudes towards transit modes changed significantly. In general, people exhibited less positive perceptions of transit modes in terms of service quality, a finding that was most pronounced in relation to the MTR. This aligns with findings suggesting that crime-related incidents cast a shadow over perception of transit mode (e.g., Lin et al., 2018). Our analysis also indicates that attitudes towards the social movement (captured by perceptions of the movement and the boycotting and vandalising of MTR facilities) were significantly related to changes in perceptions of transit services (i.e., the MTR service became worse, a perception less pronounced for bus and mini-bus).

The SEM analysis further confirmed the results of the preliminary analysis. In particular, attitudes towards the social movement were found to be negatively associated with attitudes towards MTR and positively linked to attitudes towards bus and mini-bus. This supports our expectation that stronger agreement with the social movement reduced the attractiveness of the target mode while having the opposite effect on alternative modes. Contradicting previous research (e.g., Bamberg et al., 2003), past behaviour did not significantly affect people's attitudes towards transit modes in less regular conditions, such as transit disruptions, especially in the case of social movements, where individual emotions - aroused by social events and political views - may play a more dominant role. However, past use of bus and mini-bus were also associated with people's attitudes towards the social movement (e. g., boycotting MTR services and vandalising MTR infrastructure). This suggests that past usage and experience of transit modes may also influence their support of the social movement. Finally, we also detected marked differences between social groups (e.g., educational attainment, housing type and employment status) in terms of attitudes towards the social movement and transit modes, suggesting their differentiated reactions to the social movement and perception of transit disruption.

To this end, the current study's findings can inform the management of the transit system during transit disruptions caused by social movements. Concerning the behaviour of transit passengers, several strategies can be adopted. First, transit agencies could better consider people's political inclinations when predicting changes in travel demand, which have been shown capable of influencing individual attitudes towards different transit modes and arguably, their choice of transit mode. Specifically, transit agencies can garner information about people's attitudes towards the social movement from various platforms (e.g., social media and online surveys) and use such information in conjunction with ridership data (e.g., smart card data) to conduct analyses to identify which groups of transit passengers are more likely to continue using the affected mode and which are more likely to shift to alternative modes. These findings can be used to establish simulation models of the spatial and temporal changes in demand for different transit modes (e.g., trip time and route and destination choice). In addition, customised information about transit services and schedules can be disseminated to groups with differentiated attitudes towards the social movement and transit modes (Zhang et al., 2021).

Furthermore, the transit agency should pay attention to both the affected system (e.g., MTR) and the alternative modes (e.g., bus and mini-bus). For the affected system, re-scheduling of routes and service time will be needed in accordance with both the level of disruption and the changed demand of passengers (Jespersen-Groth et al., 2009). Given that the MTR is the backbone of Hong Kong's public transport system, its disruption can hugely impact residents' daily mobility. Notably, the MTR operates a number of short-distance bus routes that serve as first-/last-mile solutions in the NT (e.g., Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun). If some MTR stations are disrupted again in the future, suspending services, part of this MTR bus fleet can be dispatched as an emergency response to the affected areas, enabling the evacuation of passengers and serving as a timely shuttle service delivering individuals to nearby functioning stations. Outside the affected system, alternative transit services (e.g., bus and mini-bus) should be added also based on the predicted travel demand. The government should develop a road-map for the legalisation of certain micro-mobilities that have been widely adopted elsewhere in the world (e.g., e-scooter, Uber, which have not been legalized in Hong Kong as of November 2023) to allow for more mobility alternatives that would benefit residents, especially during transit system disruptions. By simultaneously considering these aspects, the impact of transit disruption can be significantly mitigated.

## 6. Conclusion

Our study has demonstrated that people's attitudes towards social movements and, to some extent, local politics, may also influence their perceptions of transit modes, in turn impacting their choice of mode. The findings have implications that can inform the development of contingency plans for the public transport system under similar conditions. In particular, this study provides an enhanced evidence base for (1) better understanding and anticipating behavioural change in relation to transit disruptions caused by massive-scale social movements and (2) adjusting transit services to better meet the travel demands of people with distinctive political stances during transit disruptions. Furthermore, although the case study examined is unique, we expect the conceptual framework and certain implications to be transferrable to other contexts, especially where public transport is politicised. In particular, we contend that people's attitudes towards politics should be considered when anticipating travel behaviour changes during transit disruptions related to politicised social events.

Despite some new insights, the study has some limitations. These limitations can inform the development of future research. First, due to the length and costs associated with the survey, we only included questions about general responses but not responses regarding trips for different purposes. To obtain more in-depth insights, it would be worthwhile to probe such detailed behavioural dimensions. Related to this issue, a second potential avenue would involve investigating potential inequalities in daily mobility across different social strata (Tao and He, 2021). In particular, whether low-income groups become more restrained and less able to maintain daily life in the context of MTR disruptions. Third, while MTR disruptions related to social movements are only temporary, the resulting impact on people's attitudes and travel behaviour can be somewhat lasting, something not captured by the current study. Future research should also examine how people's attitudes towards transit modes and social movements change over a longer period (e.g., 1-3 years after the disruption). Of particular interest will be how long it may take before people's attitudes and behaviour return to a previous state. Finally, we employed an online survey approach to collect data. This approach can be limited in its capacity to produce more generalisable outcomes due to the characteristics of online users. Future research should test the results of the current study using in-situ surveys.
