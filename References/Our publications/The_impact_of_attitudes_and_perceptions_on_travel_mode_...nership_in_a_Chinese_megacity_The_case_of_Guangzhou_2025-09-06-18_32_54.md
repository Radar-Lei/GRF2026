## A B S T R A C T

The objective of this research is to understand intentions to buy a car and how car-ownership, together with other personal, situational and attitudinal factors, influences travel mode choice in a Chinese megacity. A survey was carried out in Guangzhou, China to examine respondents' car ownership and travel mode perceptions and choices, as well as personal and situational characteristics. A quota sampling procedure was used to select members of three different groups: car owners; no car but planning to buy one in the next 5 years - car intenders; and no car and not planning to buy one. We find that car ownership is the most important among included predictors of travel mode choice, which also depend on other personal and situational factors, but only indirectly by attitudinal factors. However, attitudinal factors have a strong impact on the intention to buy a car, while controlling for other personal and situational factors. Our results suggest that several policies can be further improved in China for greater effectiveness in reducing the car use of car owners and car intenders.

## 1. Introduction

Car ownership is a key factor in an individual's activity-travel behavior (Bhat & Pulugurta, 1998; Hanson & Hanson, 1981). The link between car ownership and travel mode has been extensively demonstrated by models of joint ownership-mode choice (Train, 1980; de Palma & Rochat, 2000) or simply including the indicator of car numbers or availability in models of travel mode choice (Buehler, 2011; Cervero & Day, 2008; He, 2011). Because car ownership is one of the most important factors that may lead to driving and because disposing of a car is not so easy once acquired (Dargay, 2001), extensive research has focused on this decision-making. Several key determinants have been identified, including income, household structure, lifecycle, location, and land use

(Dargay & Gately, 1999; Dargay, 2001; Nolan, 2010; Potoglou & Kanaroglou, 2008; Whelan, 2007). However, attitudinal information has often been ignored, plausibly due to the lack of attitude questions in car ownership surveys (Jong, Fox, Daly, Pieters, & Smit, 2004). Yet, attitudes can be quite persistent, which may explain why the dominance of car use has not been reversed in many countries despite continual efforts in transit development (Hensher, 1998).

Hence, attitudinal information should be included in travel demand modeling for a better understanding of travel behavior (Brown & Werner, 2008; Choo & Mokhtarian, 2004; Dobson, 1975; Golob, Horowitz, & Wachs, 1979; Handy, Cao, & Mokhtarian, 2005; Noblet, Thogersen, & Teisl, 2014). Considering the attitude-behavior relationship, the attitude has been used as a benchmark in understanding the effect of various changes in the transportation system and policy including temporary highway closures (Fujii, Gärling, & Kitamura, 2001), temporary road pricing (Gehlert, Kramer, Nielsen, & Schlag, 2011; Winslott-Hiselius, Brundell-Freij, Vagland, & Byström, 2009), a free transit pass (Fujii & Kitamura, 2003; Thøgersen & Møller, 2008), and suchlike. Repeated observations of people's attitudes before and after the changes showed that structural changes in the transit system can alter attitudes towards travel modes and habits.

Thus far, only a few travel surveys in fast motorizing countries such as China have collected information concerning people's travel relevant attitudes; mapping out the determinants of car ownership is especially urgent. The economic boom in China has led to an inevitable growth in car use (Hook & Replogle, 1996; Pucher, Peng, Mittal, Zhu, & Korattyswaroopam, 2007). A critical transportation challenge China is facing in its rapid urbanization is fast-growing car ownership and ever-increasing car use. Passenger vehicles (trucks excluded) increased from a quarter-of-a-million to 50 million between 1990 and 2010; this is a 200-fold increase (National Bureau of Statistics, 2011). It has been projected that 25% of urban households will own a car in 2030 and that China will then overtake the U.S.A. as the largest car fleet country in the world (Chamon, Mauro, & Okawa, 2008).

During the same period of China's urbanization, we have witnessed progressive railway development. The country's first urban railway line opened in Beijing in 1969. By 2000, besides Beijing, railway systems were operating only in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In the following decade, more railway lines were opened in several major cities such as Shenzhen, Chongqing, and Wuhan. As of September 2012, new railway construction and expansion has been approved for a further 28 cities. The rapid pace of railway development, due to its speed and huge capital involved, has been called rail's Great Leap Forward by various media. In the era of China's fast expansion of urban metro networks in its large cities, people's perception of the transit system is expected to improve, but will it be sufficient to compete with private vehicles so as to reduce car ownership and use? If the main drive behind people's choice of travel is the image and perceived service quality between public transit and cars (Prioni & Hensher, 2000), then a thorough understanding of individuals' travel relevant attitudes is needed for transport planners and policy-makers to design effective strategies and programs.

On this background, the objective of this research is to provide a better understanding of the reasons why residents of a Chinese megacity, Guangzhou, increasingly travel by car rather than transit and why they increasingly buy cars, including both personal and situational determinants and attitudes towards cars and transit. Special attention is given to the role of outcome expectations and attitudes for travel mode choice and for the decision to buy a car.

## 2. Literature review

As it appears from the introduction, there is mixed evidence whether transit development leads to less car use. Some studies have found a positive impact of railway lines on the use of transit. For example, Cervero and Day (2008) found that movers to a precinct near a railway station in a suburb of Shanghai were encouraged to switch to transit riding, but only from non-motorized means of travel. The authors shy away from the fact that the percentage of car users switching to transit use was rather minimal and that the majority of car users continued to drive after moving to their new residence. Car owners seem to be reluctant to change mode regardless of the built environment's characteristics, such as proximity to metro and the street connectivity. Therefore, whether "transit-oriented development holds considerable promise for placing rapidly suburbanizing Chinese cities on a more sustainable pathway" (Cervero & Day, 2008, p. 315) needs further validation.

Similarly, Pan, Shen, and Liu (2011) examined two railway station areas on the periphery of Shanghai and evaluated the effects of transit-oriented development (TOD) on the travel behavior of residents. The survey data indicated that the new railway line had a modest impact of people's travel behavior, this being indicated by the relatively small proportion of commuting trips among the various trip purposes. More importantly, their survey revealed that residents in the TOD areas (within a half-mile from the station) and those living farther away from the station had the same percentage of car owners or people who planned to purchase a car within next three years, thereby suggesting a weak effect of TOD on car purchase in this context. The survey also reported a high rate of car use among respondents currently owning or who were seriously considering buying a car. Therefore, they summarized that "TOD at the urban periphery might face greater challenges to achieve the planning goal of a substantial reduction in car use" (p. 101). In fact, not only is the effect of TOD on car use suppression on the periphery questionable, but even its effects on the city center seem rather elusive.

A recent study on the impact of compact rail transit corridors on automobile use in Los Angeles, which has made substantial investments in transit-oriented development adds further nuances to this question (Houston, Boarnet, Ferguson, & Spears, 2015). A county wide survey with 8219 households revealed that residents living along the rail corridor drove less and rode public transit more than the county average, but also significant spatial differences over different rail lines. Households along an older subway corridor with more near-transit development tended to have higher transit ridership and fewer daily miles driven than households along a newer light rail line. Hence, it seems that both the development patterns of the urban area and the preferences and composition of residents are important factors influencing travel mode choice.

Based on interviews with about 400 car owners in Hong Kong, Cullinane and Cullinane (2003) studied why people are still reliant on their car even though the public transit systems is highly efficient by international standards. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank the three main reasons for owning a car. The relevancy of public transit is shown to be relatively low: two reasons related to transit - "don't' like public transport" and "public transport not available" - are ranked only 7 and 9 among the 11 reasons. They suggested that transit development might not always work for frequent car users. On the other hand, the main reasons for initial car purchase are "helpful for carrying things", "saves time", and "more comfortable". Also, it is found that annual mileage and considering a car a necessity increases with the length of car ownership. Based on these findings, the authors implied that car ownership increases car use.

A recent study in Bangalore, India (Verma, Manoj, & Verma, 2016), found that young adults here hold a significantly more positive attitude towards car ownership than in Hong Kong and that a much higher share of young adults here wants to buy a car in the near future than in Hong Kong (cf. Cullinane, 2002). Verma et al. (2016) also found that the latent car demand among young adults in Bangalore was especially prevalent among those who come from car owning families and those who have education at or above post-graduation level.

Another stream of research shows that when people have become used to driving, breaking their driving habits is difficult (Anable, 2005; Bamberg & Schmidt, 2003; Bamberg, Rölle, & Weber, 2003; Ding, Wang, Tang, Mishra, & Liu, 2016; Fujii et al., 2001; Gärling & Axhausen, 2003; Thogersen & Møller, 2008). This line of research also suggests that the persistency in a traveler's habits and attitudes may reduce or even outweigh the effect of the built environment, such as improved transit accessibility.

Related research has found that car ownership influences attitudes towards public transit (Beirão & Sarsfield Cabral, 2007; Ibrahim, 2003; Thogersen, 2006). For example, based on a qualitative study assessing people's attitudes towards public transport and cars in Porto, Portugal, by means of in-depth interviews, Beirão and Sarsfield Cabral (2007) concluded that attitudes are a key determinant of mode choice, and that participants using different modes evaluate bus and car travel differently. The sample consisted of 24 regular and occasional users, including seven public transit users, ten car users, and seven who used both transit and cars. Regular bus users perceived the bus service more positively than the non-users. People who had not taken the bus in recent years had a very negative perception of the level of service. If some highly valued features such as frequency, reliability, and comfort level were not satisfied, people were likely to switch to driving.

Similarly, Ibrahim (2003) studied the attitudes of car owners and non-owners towards different transport modes for shopping trips in Singapore. This research included both qualitative and quantitative components. For the qualitative part, 30 in-depth interviews were conducted in shopping centers in one of the four regional centers of Singapore. The interviews showed that car owners and non-car owners had different attitudes towards various transportation modes, especially public transit systems and private cars. For the quantitative part, 1100 questionnaires were sent out to households living in a housing estate in a town outside the main urban area. The study revealed that car owners rated most dimensions of car use higher than non-owners. Non-owners, in general, perceived most of the attributes of buses and the Mass Rail Transit system (MRT) more positively than car owners.

Most of the mentioned studies are cross-sectional, but also panel studies have confirmed the interrelationship between attitudes and behavior. For example, in a theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework, Thogersen (2006) explored the repetitive nature of people's travel mode in Denmark. Three waves of phone interviews were conducted with a one-year interval between waves. In the cross-sectional model, traveling by public transport was found to be influenced by attitudes, perceived control, and car ownership, but not by subjective norms. Car ownership negatively influenced subjective norms, attitudes, and perceived control regarding traveling by public transport. In the panel analysis, past behavior had a strong effect on current behavior, whereas the effects of other factors was substantially attenuated when controlling for past behavior. More importantly, past public transport use had a significant positive impact on the individual's current attitude towards using public transport and on current perceived control and it played a negative role for attitudes towards car ownership, which in turn had an effect on current behavior. For car owners the attitude-behavior relationship for traveling by public transport was weaker, meaning that past behavior had a stronger influence on current behavior than attitudes.

Similarly, Clark at al. (2016) used two waves of panel data from 15,200 UK households in 2009 and 2010 to investigate the relationship between commute mode, spatial context, life events and environmental attitude. The study revealed that car commuting is very stable over a year as only 10% of the car commuters changed their travel mode in the following year. The authors concluded that moving home or changing job are the major drivers of commute mode changes. In addition, people with pro-environmental attitudes are more likely to switch away from car commuting, and the attitudinal orientation was found to precede changes in travel mode choice, which suggests a causal relationship.

In sum, previous research suggest that both travel mode choices and the decision to buy a car are co-determined by the person's travel-relevant attitudes and personal as well as contextual background characteristics and that, once acquired, owning a car has a profound effect on travel mode choice (Ettema, Friman, Gärling, & Olsson, 2015; Gärling & Loukopoulos, 2007a; Kamruzzaman, Shatu, Hine, & Turrell, 2015). Hence, not only characteristics of the context, but also travel-relevant attitudes should be taken into account in travel demand management and research. However, panel research demonstrates that car-related attitudes are not only determinants of, but also determined by people's travel-related choices, including both mode choices and the acquisition of a car. This research integrates these insights in an integrated study of both car acquisition and travel mode choice as illustrated in Fig. 1.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1. Study area

This research was carried out in one of China's six "megacities" (i.e., cities with more than ten million people, cf. Gilbert, 1993), Guangzhou. The city had a population of approximately 13 million in 2011 (Guangzhou Bureau of Statistics, 2012). Compared with other cities, megacities usually suffer from more serious transport problems, such as energy use, noise, air pollution, traffic and fatalities, parking shortage and congestion (Gwilliam, 2003; Pucher et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2010). Understanding the mechanism of travel mode choice in megacities has become a vital issue to promote sustainable transport system and further contribute to efficient urban growth management. The six megacities in China generally have a more developed economy than cities below ten million, in terms of gross regional product (GRP) and GRP per capita. ${}^{1}$ Besides,travel demand and car ownership is also higher in megacities than that in smaller cities, which subsequently leads to more total passenger traffic.

Guangzhou is the principal city of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and Southern China. It is a typical "first-tier" Chinese city, which is populous, fast-growing, and relatively wealthy, has easy access to transit and increasing car saturation and congestion. As part of the central government's initiative to reform urbanization in China, Guangzhou has been designated as one of the five National Central Cities.

The jurisdiction of Guangzhou consists of ten districts and two county-level cities (Fig. 2). The three oldest districts - Yuexiu, Liwan, and Haizhu - form the urban core of Guangzhou, whereas the Tianhe, Baiyun, and Huangpu districts are relatively new urban districts experiencing faster growth. In particular, the Tianhe District, where the central business district (CBD) of Guangzhou is located, has pioneered the development of the economic and financial sectors. The newest five districts/county-level cities - Luogang, Panyu, Huadu, Conghua City, and Zengcheng City - form the suburbs/outskirts of the metropolitan area. Nansha used to belong to Panyu District but nowadays it is an independent district; in 2005, Nansha was approved by the State Council to become a State-level New Area.

Like other Chinese megacities, Guangzhou is experiencing rapid motorization. Many residents aspire to become car owners and experience a middle-class lifestyle. Although the so-called "middle class" has a loose definition in the Chinese context, two main criteria indeed refer to having your own apartment and your own car. In the period 2002 to 2014, the number of cars grew from 0.29 to 1.79 million, with an annual growth rate consistently above 15% until 2012, where it slowed down to 10.6%, dropping further to 4.9% and 3.8% in 2013 and 2014. This drop in the private vehicle growth was primarily due to the municipal government's imposing a private vehicle restriction schedule on July 1st, 2012 through license plate auctions and lotteries (Guangzhou Transport Planning Research Institute, 2012).

Meanwhile, the city is undergoing progressive transit expansion. For the public transit systems, there are over 13,888 buses in the fleet (Guangzhou Bureau of Statistics, 2014). The first metro line opened in 1997; in 2016 the system has six operating lines. As of 2014, the daily passenger trip boarding had reached over 7 million, accounting for ${47}\%$ of all public transport trips. In 2014,the construction investment totaled RMB 69.5 billion, covering the construction of new and extension lines, the Guangzhou-Foshan intercity rail transit, and the Automated People Mover (APM) in Zhujiang New Town. The progressive investments in the urban rail systems have improved the level of service and in the meantime are changing the residents' access to rail stations. This continual effort in improving the city's transit systems may lead to people developing more favorable attitudes towards transit compared to cars, which may in turn affect people's car ownership choice.

### 3.2. Data collection

A survey was conducted in Guangzhou in the summer of 2013 examining residents' car ownership and travel mode choices and other relevant personal and situational characteristics. The questionnaire contained questions about car-ownership status, characteristics of their commute, the use of different travel modes, outcome expectations regarding the use of a car versus transit, and personal background characteristics, in that order, in addition to questions not pertinent to the present paper.

Data collection was carried out near the metro stations in four districts of the city, including two districts from the city's old core - Liwan and Haizhu, one urban district encompassing the city's CBD

- Tianhe, and one suburban district - Panyu. We used the following quotas to ensure a broad and diverse geographical coverage of the city: ${50}\%$ were sampled from the Liwan and Haizhu districts, 30% from the Tianhe district, and 20% from the Panyu district.

The interviewers were instructed to approach pedestrians on the street and conduct face-to-face interviews with those in the target group agreeing to participate. The target population was limited to those between age 18 and 65 and having lived in Guangzhou for at least a year. The latter is because recent migrants to the city might not yet have acquainted themselves with the built environment and might not fully understand their need for mobility. For those qualified, a quota sampling procedure was adopted in each district such that an equal share of respondents belonged to each of three car ownership groups: (1) car owners; (2) no car but planning to buy one within the next five years - car intenders; and (3) no car and not planning to buy one within the next five years. Participants were offered a souvenir as an incentive to complete the interview, which lasted 15-20 minutes.

A total of 1000 residents of Guangzhou ${}^{2}$ were interviewed, including 322 car owners, 319 persons planning to buy a car within the next five years, and 359 persons with no plans to buy a car within the next five years. The majority of car owners (95.3%) have only one car, 4.4% have two cars while only 0.3% have three cars. The characteristics of each group and the whole sample are summarized in Table 1.

### 3.3. Measures

The frequency of car-use and use of public transportation was measured with the following question: "How often do you use the following transport modes?" with one item for "car" and two items for public transportation ("subway" and "bus"). Respondents could choose between four ordered responses: (1) never, (2) seldom, (3) sometimes, and (4) often. Responses to the two latter items are quite strongly correlated $\left( {r = {0.44}}\right)$ and their average is hence used in the following statistical analyses, referred to as "use of public transportation".

In order to measure respondents' attitudes towards traveling by car versus transit they assessed 21 possible outcomes of motorized travel (compiled by the authors from the literature) using a semantic differential scale from 1 (cars are much better than public transport) to 5 (public transport is much better than cars). The items are listed in Table 2 below. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify important broader attitudes that citizens of Guangzhou use for evaluating motorized travel modes against each other, as reflected in these outcome expectations.

The participants were also asked a number of questions about the public transport service and their possible commute to work or study. Specifically, they were asked the time it took and to rate the level of convenience of walking from home to the nearest subway station and the nearest bus stop, respectively, the latter on a scale from 1 (very convenient) to 3 (inconvenient). The latter two items are only moderately correlated $\left( {r = {0.28}}\right)$ and are,hence,used as single-item constructs in the analyses.

In the questionnaire, we also had questions about the residential location and work location, but since the majority of the respondents did not answer these questions in details, especially for work location, we only include the residential location at the district level in the analyses. To control for the commute distance/ time, participants were also asked the time that a commute would normally start and end, from which the typical duration of their commute could be calculated. And they were asked to name how they typically (i.e., most often) commute.

### 3.4. Data analysis

SPSS 21 was used for exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression analyses and AMOS 21 (Arbuckle, 2006) for structural equation modeling (SEM). The main advantage of SEM is that it is possible to explicitly account for measurement error when a latent variable of interest is represented by multiple manifest variables. Measures of how well the implied variance-covariance matrix, based on the parameter estimates, reflects the observed sample variance-covariance matrix can be used to determine whether the hypothesized model gives an acceptable representation of the analyzed data.

The usual assumptions about uncorrelated unique ("error") terms and a simple structure factor pattern in the measurement model were applied. When only one item represents a latent construct, as for example driving frequency in the present study, the measurement error cannot be estimated but must be set at a fixed value, usually zero. As is commonly the case in behavioral research, there are instances of item non-response in the analyzed data set. In the SEM analyses, we use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) to deal with item non-response. Currently, FIML is considered the most effective method to deal with missingness due to item non-response, not only because it minimizes the loss of information and, hence, statistical power, but also because it leads to the most unbiased parameter estimates (Arbuckle, 1996).

## 4. Results

In this section, we first present the exploratory factor analysis of participants' outcome expectations regarding traveling by car versus public transport. Next, we present the SEM predicting the frequency of traveling by car and public transport based on (1) situational factors, personal factors and attitudes and (2) these same factors and car ownership status. Finally, we present a logistic regression analysis of the first mentioned factors' ability to predict non-car-owners' intentions to buy a car within the next five years.

### 4.1. Outcome expectations regarding driving vs. using public transport

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify important attitudes (i.e., the latent dimensions reflected in their expressed outcome expectations) that these consumers use for evaluating motorized travel modes against one another. A standard EFA of the 21 included possible expected outcomes of traveling by car versus public transport was done using principal component analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization. In order to produce a clearer factor pattern and to align the EFA better with the subsequent SEM analysis, the coefficient display format was set to suppress coefficients below 0.50 . The individual outcome expectations and their rotated factor pattern are reported in Table 2.

The EFA identified six factors with an eigenvalue of at least 1 , which accounted for ${62}\%$ of the total variance. The rotated component matrix (Table 2) shows that this EFA reduces 18 of the 21 items to five latent constructs reflected in more than one item and that the three remaining items (i.e., status, stress and costs) do not load substantially on any of these five constructs.

The first factor captures six items (personal space, enjoyment, privacy, ease of carrying personal belongings and luggage, and vehicle cleanliness; Cronbach’s Alpha $= {0.82}$ ) that seem to reflect the person's expected affective wellbeing (being at ease vs uneasy) when traveling by car vs. public transport. The second factor captures five items (time saving, flexibility, speed, convenience, and comfort; Cronbach’s Alpha $= {0.79})$ that seem to reflect expectations regarding the functionality of the travel mode. The third factor captures three items (congestion, environmental friendliness, safety from vehicle accidents; Cronbach’s Alpha $= {0.80}$ ) that reflect expected negative externalities of the travel mode. The fourth factor captures two items (extra activity and travel opportunities and protection from weather; Pearson’s $r = {0.41}$ ) that seem to reflect expected "fringe benefits" of the travel modes. The fifth and last factor also captures two items (accessibility and reliability and punctuality; Pearson’s $r = {0.47}$ ) that seem to reflect the expected everyday "effectiveness" of the travel mode. As previously mentioned, the final three included potential outcomes (status, stress, costs) do not appear to reflect a broader latent construct and are hence kept as single items in the subsequent statistical analyses.

Table 2 also reports the mean scores on the individual items. It appears that residents of Guangzhou perceive cars more favorably than public transport on all included dimensions except costs and negative externalities. Public transport is evaluated more favorably than car only with regards to costs while both travel modes are evaluated equally with regard to negative externalities.

#### 4.1.1. Discussion of exploratory factor analysis results

As expected, the EFA revealed that travelers' outcome expectations regarding motorized travel options (i.e., private car vs. transit) are correlated and that they reflect broader, more comprehensive attitudes towards travel modes. By taking this factor pattern into account when performing multivariate statistical analyses of travel-related choices, replacing travelers' outcome expectations by these more comprehensive attitudes, one can avoid multicollinearity without throwing away potentially important information about travelers' motivation. It also appears from Table 2 that residents of Guangzhou, like most other places (e.g., Beirão & Sarsfield Cabral, 2007; Gärling & Schuitema, 2007; Hensher, 1998), evaluate private cars more favorably than transit on practically all dimensions, except for costs, implying that most people prefer to travel by car if they can afford it.

### 4.2. Predicting travel mode choice

We present two SEM analyses predicting the frequency of traveling by car and public transport: one based on personal factors, situational factors and attitudes and one adding car ownership status to these predictors. In a first exploratory analysis, we included all personal factors, situational factors, and attitudes (represented by the latent variables and single-item outcome expectations emanating from the EFA) as predictors. However, in order to simplify the presentation of results, we dropped independent variables that did not significantly $\left( {\mathrm{p} < {0.05}}\right)$ contribute to explained variance in any of the models. The final structural models are presented in Table 3. We report the standardized regression coefficients because these are the most useful in the present case (i.e., they are comparable and informative of the relative impact of the different independent variables).

The fit indices reported in the note of Table 3 show that both models give an excellent representation of the data. When comparing the two models, it is obvious that car ownership has a decisive impact on travel behavior in this Chinese megacity, as has been found in studies elsewhere as well (e.g., Buehler, 2011; Cervero & Day, 2008; Gärling & Loukopoulos, 2007a; He, 2011; Kitamura, 1989). Car ownership alone accounts for half of the explained variance for car use and one fifth of explained variance for the use of public transportation. The standardized regression weights also show that car ownership is by far the most important of the included predictors of the use of both travel modes.

The results of Model 1 reveal that travel mode choice is mostly determined by personal and situational factors while attitudinal factors only influence car use, not the use of public transportation (when personal and situational factors are controlled). Furthermore, when controlling for car ownership (Model 2), the impact of attitudinal factors on car use practically disappears. A marginally significant impact of the evaluation of the two travel modes in terms of negative externalities, i.e., pollution, congestion and accidents, is all that remains. Hence, it seems that practically all attitudinal impacts on car use are mediated through car ownership, which we will return to for more discussion later. The signs of the regression weights show that people tend to use cars more the better they believe cars compare to public transport in terms of risks of negative externalities, effectiveness (i.e., reliability and accessibility) and status and they tend to use cars less the better they believe cars compare to public transport in terms of "fringe benefits", i.e., extra activity and travel opportunities and protection from weather. The latter result is contra-intuitive and one might speculate that it reflects the reverse causality to the one assumed by the model, and that the experience one gets from traveling by car in Guangzhou is less favorable in this respect than expected by those who never or rarely drive.

Regarding personal factors, Table 3 reveals that residents of Guangzhou use public transportation more if they are women, single, have a low household income, do not own their home, and/ or have an occupation as entrepreneur, clerk or student. Except for gender, these personal factors are also significantly related to car use, but with the reverse effect. Model 2 shows that the impacts of income and home ownership are fully or partly (home ownership on car use) mediated through car ownership.

Finally, regarding situational factors, Table 3 reveals that residents of Guangzhou use public transport less if they live in the new urban districts (i.e., Tianhe, Baiyun, Huangpu) than in the core districts or outskirt areas of the city. They use public transport more and cars less the more convenient access they believe they have to buses and they use public transport more the longer their commute. They use public transport (but not car driving) less when their primary mode of commuting is walking (i.e., when they live close to their workplace).

#### 4.2.1. Discussion of structural equation modeling results

The structural equation modeling confirms that travelers' mode choice in this Chinese megacity is influenced by personal, situational and attitudinal factors. However, personal and situational factors are by far the strongest predictors, especially if car ownership is included among these factors. The attitudinal factors only influence car-use and they disappear when controlling for car ownership. Hence, it seems that the use of public transport in Guangzhou is not a matter of preference (i.e., motivation) or choice, but forced by the (private and contextual) situation. Residents of Guangzhou who do not have access to a car have no other options than using public transportation for longer trips. Because car-owners in principle have both options, there is room for attitudes to influence car-use. This is also reflected in participants' reported primary commuting mode. Among car owners, 52%, 21% and 13% report that they use a car, subway and bus as their primary commuting mode, respectively. Among non-car owners, the modal split is $4\% ,{37}\%$ and ${35}\%$ ,reflecting that few of them have the option to use a car. Further, the finding that the influence of attitudinal factors disappears when controlling for car ownership suggests that this influence is mediated through car-ownership. Hence, in order to get a full understanding of people's travel mode choices, it is important to also study what influences their decision to buy a car.

### 4.3. Reasons to buy a car

As mentioned above, it is likely that car ownership is not only a function of, but also influences outcome expectations and attitudes regarding different travel modes. In order to avoid the potential confusion arising from this two-way causality, we investigate determinants' of non-owners' intentions to buy a car (within the next five years) in the following, excluding car owners from the analysis. We obviously cannot be sure that acquisition decisions by aspiring future car-owners are influenced in the same way as those by current car-owners, but knowledge about the former is arguably most policy relevant in the current situation in China. Intentions are not behaviors, but at least for costly behaviors such buying a car, it is reasonable to assume that forming an intention is a prerequisite for behavior (Fazio & Towles-Schwen, 1999). When people have formed a firm intention to act, they are assumed to act on their intention when the right opportunities for doing so arise (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2009).

As mentioned above, we sampled an approximately equal number of people with no intentions to buy a car and people intending to buy a car within the next five years. We used this screening variable as the (binary) dependent variable in a series of logistic regression (LR) analyses of the impacts of personal, situational and attitudinal factors on intentions to buy a car (Table 4). In these analyses, attitudinal factors identified by the factor analysis (Table 2) are represented by indexes calculated as the mean of scores on the items loading on a factor.

Model 1 in Table 4 shows that household income and the person's occupation account for about ${10}\%$ of the variance in intentions. The likelihood that a person intends to buy a car increases with income and is also higher for persons in certain occupations (i.e., entrepreneurs and employees in foreign firms) while it is lower in other occupations (i.e., students).

Model 2 shows that two situational factors, the district where the participant was sampled and most likely either live or work and whether or not one needs to transfer when commuting to work account for additional $2\%$ of explained variance. The likelihood that a person intends to buy a car is higher if the person needs to transfer during commuting and it is lower for participants from the new urban districts than in the other areas covered by the survey.

Model 3 shows that attitudinal factors are very important for intentions to buy a car, the inclusion of these variables leading to a doubling of explained variance. The negative sign of three of these attitudinal variables show that, as expected, the likelihood of having intentions to buy a car increases with the favorability of the evaluation of the private car compared to transit in terms of affective wellbeing while traveling, functionality, and negative externalities. Surprisingly, the likelihood of intending to buy a car appears to be lower the better they believe cars compare to transit in terms of "fringe benefits", i.e., extra activity and travel opportunities and protection from weather. ${}^{3}$

Finally, Model 4 shows that adding how frequently the person currently travels by car increases explained variance by about $2\%$ . The sign of the regression weight shows that the person is less likely to intend to buy a car the more he or she currently travels by car.

#### 4.3.1. Discussion of logistic regression results

These LR analyses reveal that also intentions to buy a car are co-determined by personal, situational, and attitudinal factors. When comparing this analysis with the SEM analysis, it appears that attitudinal factors influence intentions to buy a car more than everyday travel mode choice. Generally, the more favorably the person evaluates the private car compared to public transport in terms of both functionality, wellbeing during traveling and negative externalities, the more likely he or she is to intend to buy a car. Higher income and aspirations of higher income (reflected in the person's occupation) also increase the likelihood that the person wants to buy a car. The physical reality in terms of where one lives and work and the quality of the public transit for commuting (reflected in the need to transfer) also influences intentions to buy a car, but apparently less so than personal and attitudinal factors.

## 5. Discussion and policy implications

Several implications for transport policy can be drawn from this research. First, transit planners can certainly work on the transit systems such that their competitiveness in the market is improved. From the transport planning perspective, it is essential to identify what residents perceive to be the most influential measures of service quality in the system. Our study revealed that the quality of the transit system influences both car acquisition and use, both directly and indirectly (through outcome expectations and attitudes). Hence, interventions improving the quality of the transit system in terms of speed and reliability, accessibility, and the quality of the ride would potentially increase the attractiveness of transit compared to driving.

However, it is an important caveat that several prior studies found that once a car is purchased, the owner's driving tendency is not influenced by the transit system, no matter how efficient and convenient it is. For example, Kitamura (1989) used a three-wave Dutch National Mobility Panel survey to assess the causal relationship between car ownership, car use, and transit use. After testing four hypothetical causal relationships, he found - like the present study - that a change in car ownership not only lead to a change in car use, but also in transit use. More importantly, Kita-mura argued that improving transit services may be an ineffective strategy to suppress car use because the causality as demonstrated is that "car use determines transit use, not transit use determining car use" (p. 172). Therefore, he recommended that car use management would be more effective in the long run if car ownership is controlled. The municipal government of Guangzhou chose a quite radical approach to doing so when they imposed a private vehicle restriction schedule on July 1st, 2012 through license plate auctions and lotteries (Guangzhou Transport Planning Research Institute, 2012). As reported earlier, this intervention was successful at lowering the annual growth rate in the number of cars. However, there are other and less coercive measures that might be considered as well.

It is obvious from this (and other, cf. e.g., Gärling & Loukopoulos, 2007a) research that private cars are perceived to be superior to transit in many respects. Once a car is purchased, although transportation demand management strategies could potentially discourage car use, the tendency to drive is inevitable. Hence, it is critical for more sustainable mobility patterns in China that the government continue its effort to develop and implement transport policies that effectively restrain people from owning a car in the first place.

Till 2016, eight cities in China (mostly megacities) have implemented private vehicle restriction policy where people could only get a license through license plate auctions or lotteries. In order to strictly limit the number of vehicles, these cities have also launched a series of additional requirements for the applicants. For example, in Guangzhou, only local residents having paid social insurance for more than two years are qualified to apply for a private vehicle license. Besides, to prevent the situation that some people may buy a car in a nearby city, vehicles with licenses from other cities are not allowed to drive in the center of Guangzhou from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. during weekdays, and they are also restricted in some congested road segments during both morning and evening peak hours.

Many cities around the world have implemented measures that makes driving less attractive, e.g., reducing the speed of the trip, such as reduced access of cars to the city center or reserving larger proportions of roads for walking and bicycling (Gärling & Loukopoulos, 2007a; Javid, Okamura, Nakamura, Tanaka, & Wang, 2016). Such interventions should in principle have the same effect as interventions improving the quality of transit, and perhaps in a more direct way. Another straightforward policy implication of our findings is that policies that make cars and/or car driving more expensive, i.e., increase the operating and (especially) the acquisition costs of cars, would help curb the growth in the number of cars (like, e.g., in Singapore). This can also be inferred from the persistent finding in many contexts that intentions to buy a car as well as car driving increase with income. Interventions such as these can be justified by the fact that car drivers do not pay for the full external costs of driving (Steg, 2003). It might well be that making it excessively expensive is a necessary component of any effective policy to curb the growth in the acquisition of popular products such as cars.

Third, our results regarding people's attitudes towards public transit compared to cars and the role of attitudes for the decision to buy a car also contain important information about what changes are required to make public transit more and cars less attractive as a travel mode. Our results suggest that intentions to buy a car in the future can be curbed by means of information creating more realistic outcome expectations, including correcting misperceptions about negative externalities of car driving relative to public transportation. Such information campaigns might also have the added benefit of increasing understanding and hence acceptability of the more coercive types of interventions mentioned earlier (Gärling & Loukopoulos, 2007b). However, it is important to acknowledge, both with reference to the found effect-sizes and prior disappointing experiences with information as a means to change travel related decisions and behavior, that information alone will not be sufficient to curb the growth in car ownership and driving.

${}^{3}$ This result is contra-intuitive and is also surprising in the light of the fact that the mean of this variable is practically identical across the two groups (i.e., those with and those without an intention to buy a car; ${M}_{i} = {1.9843},{M}_{n} = {1.9861}$ ; $t = {0.028},p = {977})$ . Hence,it is most likely a statistical artifact resulting from correlations between independent variables.

## 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we analyze travel mode and car ownership choices of residents of Guangzhou, one of China's largest cities. Statistics reveal and everyday experience confirms a fast-growing car ownership and ever-increasing car use in urban China, which has been attributed to the perceived attractiveness of the car (Beirão & Sarsfield Cabral, 2007; Gärling & Schuitema, 2007; Hensher, 1998), as also confirmed by this study. On this backcloth, our objective was to provide a better understanding of the reasons why residents of Guangzhou travel by car rather than transit and why they buy cars, including both personal and situational determinants and attitudes towards cars and transit. Quota sampling was used to get an equal representation of three groups: (1) car owners, (2) people without a car who plan to buy a car in the near future, and (3) people without a car who have no plans to change this situation. Special attention is given to the role of outcome expectations and attitudes for travel mode choice and the decision to buy a car.

The findings show that residents of Guangzhou, regardless of their car ownership status and use of travel modes, perceive cars as superior to transit in most respects. The only aspect where transit is evaluated favorably compared to cars is costs. Even with regard to negative externalities, which are the main reasons why China and other countries want to expand public transport rather than private car driving, residents of Guangzhou only perceive it as a tie. Further, our study reveals that attitudes towards cars compared to public transport have a strong influence on intentions to buy a car. People who have more favorable attitudes towards cars compared to public transport are also more likely to travel by car, mostly because they are more likely to own a car. When people own a car they tend to use it most of the time, which means that attitudes have no impact on travel mode choice when car-ownership is controlled. Hence, in order to curb car-driving, it is necessary to limit car-ownership.

Besides attitudes and outcome expectations, characteristics of the person and the context (such as transit accessibility and location) also influence the decision of whether or not to buy a car, and mode choice even more. Only with a sufficiently high income can a person afford a car. The significance of home ownership for travel mode choice is in conformity with residence being regarded as one of the four necessities in life in Chinese society. Once home ownership is secured, the next goal of many Chinese households would be to purchase a car and to enjoy the higher level of mobility it offers. That being said, both home ownership and cars are affordable only when a certain level of income has been reached. It seems likely that the expectation of an increased income is one of the factors that make some people who currently do not own a car plan to buy one in the foreseeable future. The finding that occupation influences a person's intentions to buy a car supports that.

Our findings justify and highlight the importance of car ownership policies in Chinese megacities. Compared with other cities in China, megacities are faced with more serious traffic problem. Therefore, they implement more aggressive ways to limit the number of cars. It is recognized that the most effective way to reduce the negative impact of private vehicles is to reduce the number of cars (Matsumoto, Sanchez-Serra, & Ostry, 2012; Plow-den, 1983). Five megacities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangz-hou, Shenzhen and Tianjin, have launched policies to control car ownership. This includes auctions or lotteries to obtain a vehicle license, limited to local citizens. Also traffic restriction policies that are based on the last digit of the license plate are popular, having been applied in eleven Chinese cities, including two megacities (Beijing and Tianjin). By contrast, measures that are popular in other parts of the world, such as fuel tax, parking fee and congestion fee, have rarely been employed in China. Some of these might be worth considering in the future to better manage car use.
